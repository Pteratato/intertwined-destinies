# #08 [Raven]

As I make my way to the bathroom I admit to myself that Mr. Tibbs is right – I can barely hold myself up. I feel as weak as a day-old kitten. Thank God there’s a seat situated in the shower. I move about slowly, walking towards the mirror with my gaze steadfastly at my feet. I grip the counter by the sink and slowly move my gaze up to meet my reflection in the mirror.

“Well, gag me with a spoon,” I breathe. Whoa… I’m at a loss for words at the reflection looking back at me. My hazel eyes are now a brilliant amber and a bit larger, now more almond-shaped and slanting upwards with long, thick eyelashes. Gone are the softly rounded cheeks from before; now my face is more angular, my cheekbones are high and prominent and my mouth is fuller and pointier than I remember. I turn my head to look at my profile, and that’s when I noticed my ears.

“Well snap, I wasn’t expecting that,” I mumble to myself. My ears are pointed like the elves and Trixie’s. I touch the point of my ears tentatively and watch them twitch ever so slightly, sensitive. Stunned, I continue to take in the many changes I endured during my awakening – or should I say *metamorphosis*?

Gone is the mousy brown hair; my hair is now the color of rich caramel with golden highlights throughout, making it look multicolored. Now it reaches past my waist and is so much thicker, with a gentle wave, and heavier than before. My skin is now a light golden brown and sparkles ever so slightly...

“Wait, that can’t be right, how am I going to explain that?”

Overall my features look similar, but different, and the longer I stare the more I realize that I like the changes. I really like them. I’m no longer ordinary. I have this Otherworldly pixie-like look about me. I think to myself, “Okay, I can do this. I can get used to this new me. It’s not so bad. I’m no longer ordinary; I’m really kind of extraordinary.”

“Raven, are you okay in there?” I hear Mr. Tibbs at the door.

“Yes, just getting acquainted with this new version of myself. Give me about ten minutes, okay?” I say through the door.

I make my way over to the shower and strip out of my oh-so-attractive hospital gown and step into the hot spray of the shower. I let it cascade over my body, and as it does so, I imagine washing the old me away to make room for the new, slightly improved version of me. Who knew how much shampoo it took to wash a mane this long and full?

Ten minutes later I’m standing in front of the basin and mirror, dressed in a green sundress that hits mid-thigh. I’ve pulled my unruly damp hair back into a high ponytail and take one last look in the mirror, steeling myself for what’s to come.

My body has also filled out, and I have a little more curve to me that I didn’t have before. I readied myself to step out into the room beyond and figure out what comes next. I sigh deeply; there is so much I don’t know, but I have Daphne and Mr. Tibbs and Trixie, and whoever else is out there that I haven’t met yet. My life up to this point has been ordinary, but I know that’s about to change. On unsteady legs, I emerge from the bathroom to meet my destiny.

[Mr. Tibbs]

She’s stunning; I can hardly breathe when I see her. She has that kind of effect on me. The past few days have been washed away. Her true form is simply beautiful and her soul sings to mine.

I hear Daphne call out in the background, “My turn, Raven, can you believe that Nemus was able to heal my leg? That cast was so itchy,” She squeals as she dives into Raven’s arms.

Raven catches her in a big hug, and I see her waver as her strength fades. I’m by her side in an instant and I catch them both before Raven has the chance to collapse under Daphne’s additional weight. She pulls back from Raven quickly, concern etched on her face.

“I should have known. I’m sorry, Raven. I thought you were feeling better. I would never have jumped you like that otherwise. Are you okay? I’m just so happy to have you back,” Daphne says.

“I’m fine, just extremely weak. How long was I out?”

“Almost a week, you need to eat and gather your strength, okay?”

“Okay, the food smells really good right now,” Raven replies with a small smile.

I sweep her up in my arms and cradle her to my chest. I hear her sigh contentedly. Just having her in my arms after waiting for so long is like coming home. It’s a balm to my aching soul. I make my way over to the table in the room and settle my precious cargo in my lap. “We have eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, syrup, biscuits and gravy. You name it, what sounds good?”

“All of it,” She chuckles with a smile and hooks her arm around my neck, leaning in to me. “Thank you.”

“For what?”

“For finding me,” she says as she lays a gentle kiss on my cheek.

“I’ll always find you.” I say taking all of her in as I breathe in her scent.

“Alright, Beautiful, let’s get you fed, okay?” I fill her plate with everything and watch what she chooses to eat to better know what she prefers. Her scent is intoxicating, and I find that I’m so distracted by her that before I know what I’m doing, I lean in to kiss her. I catch myself at the last moment and instead I run my nose along the curve of her cheek. She leans back into me for a moment as we both just sit there, absorbed in one another. The kindred bond is wreaking havoc on my self-control. As much as I want to kiss her, this is not the time, nor is it the place.

I hear several of my men clearing their throats. I pull back and gaze into her eyes.

“Raven, we have an audience.” I lean my forehead against hers. “Tonight I will make sure that we have our privacy to talk, okay?” I take a deep breath, stilling myself so I can allow her to eat.

“Tonight, Elf–man, we talk and you can help me understand what you already know. I feel like a kitten lost in high weeds learning my way. I expect you to help me, not just protect me.” She says, looking deep into my soul.” I will not have you protect me to the point of ignorance. If you try to do so, we’re going to have problems, understand?”

“You ask a lot of me, but I will promise to treat you as an equal.”

The men at the table snort in disagreement, but I know I will do everything in my power to keep my promise.

[Raven]

I turn my attention to the food in front of me, which is now cold, and realize just how famished I really am. I take solace in the fact that Mr. Tibbs is here with me as I happily devour my meal. So much has happened in such a short amount of time. I quickly realize that I have been so focused on Mr. Tibbs and Daphne that I haven’t taken in the rest of Mr. Tibbs’ men.

For the first time, I look around and begin to process that there are four other men with Mr. Tibbs, all strangers whom I have yet to acknowledge. “Wow, I’m either a total whack job or just seriously overwhelmed with everything that has just happened. Mr. Tibbs? I think that, given the circumstances, introductions are in order.”

About that time Daphne exits the bathroom looking refreshed. The bandage on her forehead is gone, along with the sling and the cast. She looks like her old self in a cute little white eyelet sundress.

“You hungry?” I ask her.

“I ate while you were cleaning up. I’m good. You forget that you’re the one that hasn’t eaten in a whole week. How are you feeling?’

“Better now that I have eaten. Have you met everybody?”

“Not everyone. Things got really crazy as the whole gang came crashing into the room. Then there was the whole scene when you were literally spinning like a top in mid-air giving off an amazing light show and transforming before my very eyes. It’s been a lot to process.” She says, only half kidding.

“I bet you were just a little freaked out. Sorry for that. I guess that couldn’t be helped, although I think you’re ahead of me in the introduction department.” I turn towards Mr. Tibbs, “Mr. Tibbs, introductions, please. I need to offer my sincere thanks to everyone.”

“No thanks are necessary, my lady.” I hear a male voice say from over my shoulder.

“I happen to disagree. And why has everyone taken to calling me ‘my lady’?” I mumble under my breath.

Mr. Tibbs smiles at me and says, “Men meet Raven; my kindred, my *intertwined*.”

“Raven, meet Tolin, Tiern, Elrond, and Nemus. Tolin and Tiern are twins and they are elves; Elrond and Nemus are druids; and you already know Trixie.” Mr. Tibbs gestures with his hand at each man in the room so that I can tell them apart.

I take a moment to assess each of the men. Torin and Tiern are definitely twins; they look so similar, both with long dirty blonde hair pulled up in a messy top knot, and twinkling brown eyes that have a mischievous look about them – pranksters to be sure. Elrond is much more reserved with his almost military-cut black hair and eyes that appear as dark as midnight, eyes that never stray very far from Daphne. Again, I take note and need to talk to Mr. Tibbs about that. Last but not least is Nemus; his dark hair is graying slightly at the temples and buzzed short on the sides, longer on the top in a wavy mass swept off his forehead. His slate gray eyes are as sharp as a hawk’s, taking in everything around him. He has an intense look about him and seems related to Elrond. They’re the only two humans in the group. All the men are exceptionally well-built as if they train daily.

“These men are my guard and are trained warriors.” Mr. Tibbs gestures to Tolin, Tiern, and Elrond, then he inclines his head toward Nemus. “Nemus’s talents lie elsewhere, but he, too, is trained in defense, as is Elrond. Nemus is just more comfortable wielding magick, and was instrumental in your awakening.”

I take a deep breath. “Thank you all so very much for coming to my aide. I appreciate all that you’ve done for me – especially you, Nemus. Without you, I might still be stuck in limbo. It was horrible, to say the least. Thank you. I will be forever in your debt,” I say, and for some silly reason I attempt a curtsy.

I hear Trixie’s snicker. Evidently she’s woken from her nap on the pillow. “That’s as sorry an excuse for a curtsy as I ever saw. You could have face-planted on the ground and it would have been more graceful.”

“Seriously, you’re going to make fun of the girl that has been in a coma for a week and just underwent a transformation from human to… I’m not sure yet?” I retort, trying to hide my snicker.

“Hey, don’t you get your panties in a bunch. I’m just pointing out the obvious. I have much to teach you before you’re ready to be presented at court,” Trixie says, hovering in front of my face with her hands on her hips.

I laugh out loud. “Trixie, you and I are going to get along just fine. Guys, thank you again. I can’t wait to get to know all of you.” I become more serious as I gesture to Daphne. “We have a lot to discuss and much to do, Daphne. I really hate to ask, but it’s been a week. I believe we have funeral arrangements to make. Are you okay with helping or would you prefer that I handle the arrangements?”’

“Ladies, we can make plans on the way,” Mr. Tibbs interjects. “We really need to get moving. I would like to have you both home before noon.”

Mr. Tibbs takes control. He seems to be excellent at issuing orders. We head out and make our way to the Hummer as Nemus persuades the hospital staff that we are ready for discharge. He casts a glamour on those of us with less-than-human-looking ears, sparkling complexions, and Trixie. We all pile in the black Hummer and, surprisingly, fit in just fine. It’s a lot more spacious than it looked from the outside.

The ride home is a somber one as we both discuss the arrangements for a family-only funeral and make appointments to meet with the estate attorneys. Because it has been a week since the accident, we agree on a closed casket service to be held the next morning. By the time we pull into the long drive that leads past the large fishing pond toward the house, I realize that I’m not sure I’m ready to walk into the house without my mother. The drive splits and Elrond stops. I look at Daphne.

“Do you want to go home or do you want to stay with me?” We grew up on the same property. Mom owns close to two hundred acres and gave all of us land to build on, so we have always been close.

“Let’s go to the main house for now” she says. “Elrond, take the drive to the right.”

He slowly continues up the drive, now flanked on either side by trees, and pulls up in front of a two-story craftsman cottage with a wraparound porch. I’m surprised to see Velma and Harley are waiting for us on the porch. They weren’t supposed to be back from their own vacation for another week. They must have heard about the accident and made it back from Ireland earlier than expected. Velma and Harley are like family. They have their own ma-and-pop diner in town and their biscuits and gravy are to die for. When they were off work they would come to our house and help. Velma would take care of the house and even do some cooking and was like a second mother to the girls. Harley took care of the grounds and has been the only male influence that the girls had ever had.

We slowly begin to exit the vehicle, and as Daphne and I make our way up the steps to the porch, Velma holds open her arms wide to pull us into a hug. Harley stands behind them with his hands on her shoulders giving her his quiet support. Daphne and I cling to Velma for a few minutes, trying to hold our tears at bay, before we pull away.

“Velma, Harley, we have some friends that you need to meet. I turn around and gesture towards the guys and begin to introduce them only to hear Mr. Tibbs say, “It’s good to see you Velma and Harley.”

My mouth drops open as I look back and forth between them. Stunned, I ask, “You know one another?”

He just looks at me and smiles. “How did you think I was able to keep tabs on you without having eyes and ears here? Velma and Harley have been keeping me abreast of your well-being for some time now.”

“Really? How is that even possible?” I ask looking back to the group standing at the base of the steps. I narrow my eyes and say, “Then I think we all have much to discuss.”

I turn back to Velma and give her another big hug, and smile up at Harley and reach out to him as well, pulling him in for another welcoming embrace.
