## #16 [Mr. Tibbs]

After a late lunch, we make our way out to the practice range that’s located between Raven’s and Daphne’s houses. All the while Trixie is fluttering about, murmuring to herself and anyone else who is listening that it’s time for the girls to kick some butt. Surprisingly, we find a large weapon shed with a variety of bows and arrows ranging from recurve, to compound, to crossbow. All of which are more sophisticated than what we have in Faerie. The guys and I pick our bows of choice, only after the girls get their bows. It’s immediately apparent that they’re very familiar with the weapons and that this is a hobby for them.

I make my way out to the first target. Four targets are set up on the range. Elrond takes his stance next to me and then Tiern and Torin. “So what are the rules?” I ask Raven with a smirk.

“Okay, big boy, each of you will have three chances to hit the bull’s-eye at your own pace. Once completed, Daphne and I will have three times to best you. Any questions?” It’s at that moment that I feel like I’ve stepped into a trap. I shift on my feet uneasily as I look at their smug faces. Okay then, game on.

I test the weight of my bow and take aim. After a few minutes, I let my arrow fly and it hits the target just to the left of the bull’s-eye. I assess my first shot and then attempt to correct my first error, and then let my second arrow fly - it hits slightly right of the bull’s-eye. I’m frustrated with my aim thus far, I take my time with my last arrow, and I hit the bull’s-eye dead center. With a smug smile, I turn to Raven and think that there’s no way that she can best me. She and Daphne wait for the others to finish while I assess the others' targets, not one of us hit the bull’s-eye all three times and I determine that we are all fairly evenly matched. As my guard and I stand together, we are feeling pretty cocky about our chances of besting the girls.

Trixie begins to chant, “Go Raven, go Daphne. Show these guys what you got!”

Raven and Daphne step up to the targets that Elrond and I had utilized for this exercise. The two of them share a quick smirk. Then in rapid succession, they fire off three arrows that hit the bull’s-eye dead center splitting the other arrows in their wake. Elrond and I look at each other, brows raised, stunned. Then they step up to Torin and Tiern’s targets and take aim and again in quick succession they both attack the bull’s-eye in rapid succession. Their accuracy is stunning. I let out a low whistle under my breath as I look at the guys’ reactions, Elrond looks as stunned as me, but Torin and Tiern both just laugh out loud all the while Trixie is doing somersaults in midair and hollering, “Now that’s what I’m talking about, you go girls!”

Apparently, the demonstration is far from over, and the girls ask Nemus to clear the targets of arrows while they exchange their recurve bows for the compound bows that Elrond and I had used. Both of the girls begin testing the weight of the bows, making a few adjustments. They step to the targets in unison, and I notice the three-fingered shooting glove and tailored quiver that each one has. They talk amongst themselves and then each of the girls take aim and once again in rapid succession, they shoot off arrows that appear in vertical and horizontal lines in the bull’s-eye of the target. I’m floored at their accuracy and just a little turned on by how confident Raven is in her ability. This is an entirely different side of her that I have not seen before.

“Give us a minute; we’re going to switch to my favorite - the crossbow.” Raven says as she steps inside the weapons shed. When she steps back outside, in the late afternoon sun she has a brown leather holster strapped low around her hips that travels down her right thigh and is strapped snug around her mid and lower thigh, over her dark shiny jeans. The crossbow is slung over her left shoulder. Daphne follows her out, but I only have eyes for Raven. She lifts those amber eyes to me, and I take all of her in as her golden brown skin sparkles under the attention of the sun. All that beautiful hair cascading down her back makes her look like a warrior goddess, and I can imagine her having a short sword strapped to the other thigh and daggers readily accessible.

“She and Daphne will begin their training in the defensive arts tomorrow,” I whisper to myself.

“Not here,” something whispers back.

“What?” I say, looking around but finding no one, not even a faerie around. Shaking my head, I look up at Raven, “Did you hear that?” 

“Hear what?” she says as she shakes her head. 

“I could swear someone is talking to me but there’s no one else around.” 

Raven looks at me like I’m crazy, so I finally say, “Okay, okay, I get it. You know what you’re doing with these weapons. We’ll begin your training tomorrow.” I say as I gaze over her again, and when I get to her face I catch that wicked smirk.

I’m pulled out of the moment when Elrond stubbornly says, “That’s fine for Raven, but I’ll not have Daphne putting herself in harm’s way.” His brooding stare challenges Daphne, daring her to dare say anything.

Quick as a snake Daphne swings the crossbow around, takes aim and fires the small crossbow dart toward Elrond. We are all too stunned to react, I whip my head around to see the eight inch dart lodged in the tree just behind Elrond, right above his head.

“Get out of my life and leave me the heck alone! You have no say in this. I will not be some defenseless damsel just waiting for my knight-in-shining-armor to come to my rescue. I will learn to defend myself, and I will become proficient at it. Now get the heck off my property!” She fumes. “You all want to say it’s your duty to protect my sister so what happens when everyone is protecting her and it leaves me vulnerable? I’m only human after all, right? Right? Isn’t that what you keep saying? Raven is Fae and a demigoddess, but I’m nothing more than human, and your duty is to Mr. Tibbs’ guard, and that’s to Raven. Not me. I will not be the weakest link here because you are afraid that this puny human can’t hold her own!” She fires two more darts at the target to her left, hitting the bull’s-eye both times. Anger rolls off her in waves.

I look back at Elrond; I can see that he’s at a loss. That’s my cue to have our private conversation now. Before I can say anything, Raven looks over at me and says quietly. “Let’s wrap this up today and head back to the house. I’ll take Daphne and talk to her and you can take this opportunity to talk some sense into Elrond. For what it’s worth, I have never seen her this angry. We will meet you guys at the house.” She gives me a tight smile.

“Come on, Elrond; let’s give her some time to cool off.” I say, heading back down the path to the house. He reluctantly follows my lead, and as he catches up to me I say, “I get it, she’s your kindred, isn’t she?” 

“Yes. I knew it the moment I looked into her eyes when we walked into that hospital room. She doesn’t understand my need to keep her safe,” he says, his dark eyes daring me to disagree.

“No, she doesn’t. Have you bothered to explain why? She probably has no idea why she feels drawn to you and wants to kill you at the same time.”

“She’s too young,” he says adamantly.

“Do you think Raven is too young for me?” I ask.

“No. I know what you’re going to say but Daphne is human, Raven is an old soul and has stepped into her role with the grace of someone twice her age. Daphne is…fragile.” He hesitates as if not sure of his words.

“Do you really think she’s fragile? She’s not just human. Even if she were, her humanness should not be a handicap, Elrond. Are you even listening to yourself? No wonder she’s pissed. You’re acting like she is something fragile that needs to be kept in a cabinet to be admired. Not the strong, confident young woman that she is. You need to open your eyes and see what the rest of us see. I know the bond is messing with you, making you irrational. Take it from someone who’s had to sit on the sidelines and watch from the cover of glamour while my kindred grew up in another realm. Do you understand now why I have been so unbearable? Why I would disappear for months on end? What I have learned is that bond or no bond, my kindred is headstrong and determined, and she will not allow me to put her on the sidelines. We are a team, and we’ll be stronger together. Do you want some advice from someone who is still figuring it all out?” 

Elrond gives me an almost imperceptible nod as we enter the front room of the house and make our way to the small library. 

“Okay then, first of all you need to apologize to her for being such a butthole. Secondly, you need to talk to her and explain the mate bond. Lastly, you need to allow her to train along with Raven. If you don’t, you cannot be on this team anymore. You are not being a team player at all. They are sisters and best friends who have suffered a terrible tragedy this past week. They need to continue working together. If you listened to her out there, she feels like we are all here for Raven and nobody is here for her and that has to change this very night. Now, Raven is going to be her biggest support out here so she can continue to heal from all this. Daphne is going to train with her sister with your blessing or without it. Without it there won’t become a Elrond and Daphne. It will continue to be Raven and Daphne. Did you see them out there together today? They were incredible. ‘Together.’ The two of them together will be a force to be reckoned with, but only at a distance. They are right; they need hand-to-hand combat training. They need to know that they can handle themselves when the time comes and not be a liability. If you want to work this out with Daphne – and I know you do – then you will have to concede on this.”

“I don’t know if I can or not. What you are saying sounds logical but when I think about her getting hurt, I go all crazy inside. How am I supposed to turn off this need to protect her?”

“The answer is that you don’t shut it off. You open it up. When Raven explained herself to me this morning, I began to see things from her point of view, and in doing so, I was able to understand that the need to keep her safe, secure, and protected also applies to her emotional well-being. I could not ignore the fact that by keeping her physical person safe I would be putting her emotional safety in jeopardy. You need to talk to her and allow the bond between the two of you to grow. Until you do so, both of you will be miserable.” 

Elrond rubs his hands over his face and breaths out through his nostrils. Then, running a hand through his short hair, he turns toward the door. Glancing back at me, he says, “Thank you for your advice. I’m going to go down by the brook to collect my thoughts. When Daphne gets back can you send her to me? You’re right on all counts. I’ve been acting like an overbearing brute.”

“What are you going to do?”

“I’m going to apologize to her even if I have to grovel. Can you make sure that everyone else steers clear of the fire pit back there? I need to make this special for her and I don’t want any interruptions.”

“I think that can be arranged. Good luck; you may need it. I certainly hope she puts the crossbow away. I thought you were a goner for sure.” I chuckle. “You should have seen the look on your face.”

“I’m just glad I didn’t wet myself; man, that would have been embarrassing. She was seriously pissed, wasn’t she? I’m not sure I want to be on the receiving end of that again, but crap if that wasn’t the sexiest thing I’ve ever seen. All that fiery red hair and glowing green eyes, she was a sight to behold.” He says with a smirk as he walks out of the room.

Now that I can breathe, my mind goes back to what Raven said at the waterfall. I think she’s right. Boy, are the two of us in trouble when it comes to the two of them... I shake my head with a stupid grin on my face, and I start to make my way to the sitting room to watch some TV and wait for everyone else to come back.

Breathing heavily once again, I think about the whisper that I heard today. What did it mean? Where did it come from? When I looked around there was no one remotely close to the area. Could I have been hearing things in the wind? Maybe it was my spirit talking to me. Was someone trying to tell me not to start training in the Mortal Realm, or something else? I need to be sure.
