# #11 [Raven]

“What? Wait- Is that it? That can’t be it.” I exclaimed.

Mr. Tibbs puts his arm around me and pulls me to him. “Patience, Raven. We also have much to discuss in private.” He says, pressing a kiss to my temple.

“But there’s so much more. What about the Tree, she needs us; she needs our help, and the kids. I vowed I would go back and help them, and by the way, who are the Formorians and the Morrigan, who is that?”

“Yes, and we’ll be there to help all of them. Wait- what…what kids? The goddess Danu has intervened for now, and the Tree of Life will not falter, not yet. We’ve been given a reprieve. You have family to tend to before we can move forward. Tomorrow will be here before you know it and I worry that you may not be prepared for all that it entails.”

The reminder is like a physical blow, and I’m at a loss for words. I’d be okay if tomorrow never comes, but we all know that’s not going to happen. His words bring me back to the reality that I haven’t wanted to face.

My family is not coming back.

“Daphne, are you staying here tonight?” I ask quietly, suddenly realizing I hadn’t considered her wishes.

“Raven, I’m going back to my house,” She says somberly. “I talked it over with Elrond, and he’s okay with it. We’ll meet back here in the morning. Elrond and Torin will go with me, leaving you, Tiern, and Nemus here. I’ve had a bit more time to come to terms with everything that has happened in the last week. I’m not saying it will be easy walking into the house without them, because it won’t be, not for a long time. It’s going to be terribly quiet and lonely there, but for tonight I need to be surrounded by the comfort of my room, my things, and all of theirs.”

“Do you need me to come with you?”

“No, I’ll be okay. I promise.” She says, pulling me into a hug. “You have other things to focus on for now.”

“Okay, but I’m sending Trixie with you to keep you company. She’ll be bored here because Mr. Tibbs and I have much to discuss. Trixie, are you okay with that?”

“Yes, my lady.” Trixie says with a curtsy.

“Oh snap, Trixie, you confuse the heck out of me going back and forth between being snarky, and then this ‘my lady’ crap. I wish you would just cut it out,” I snap. “I’ll not have you acting like I’m some sort of princess; I can assure you that I am not. I may not be human like I thought I was, but I will not have you bowing to me like that. We’re friends, and it makes me uncomfortable,” I finally mutter.

“I’m sorry, Raven. I promise to work on being my insufferable, snarky self when at all possible. I’m very happy that you are our friend.” And then, with a twinkle in her eye and a smile on her face, she flutters over to Daphne and says, “You ready? I’m more than happy to keep you company so we can get to know each other, if you’d like. And if not, I can just be there if you need my help in any way.”

“Thank you, Trixie, I feel better already.”

“Daphne, are you sure?” I ask, and she nods. “If either of you need anything we’re just a short walk or a call away.”

We make our way through the house to see them off, agreeing to meet up here bright and early tomorrow. Once they’re gone, I turn to Velma, and she informs me that the guys have been shown to the two guest rooms and that she and Harley will close up for the night.

“Should I be concerned? Daphne and Elrond seem to be inseparable.” I look at Mr. Tibbs.

“No, she should be fine. She’s in good hands. Elrond is a very honorable druid, and I suspect that the two may actually be kindred.” He says seriously.

“Really…? You know, we really need to talk about what that means. Has it only been less than a day since my awakening? It feels so much longer than that.” I say reaching out to take Mr. Tibb’s hand. “Let’s go back to the kitchen; we can sit by the fire. I have so many questions, are you ready?”

“It’s getting late, Raven; maybe we should postpone this until tomorrow? You’re going to have a full day with everything that needs to be done.” He says, pulling me in the opposite directions toward the stairs, as if having second thoughts.

“We can do this here, or we can do this upstairs, but be sure we’re doing this tonight. I have too many questions that demand answers. So make no mistake, we’ll stay up all night if that’s what it takes to satisfy my curiosity. What? Why are you looking at me like that? You said we’d talk and that’s what we’re going to do.” About that time, Torin strolls into the kitchen.

“Hey, sorry to bother you, just thought I would grab a snack before I head out to secure the perimeter. Have to keep up with this amazing physique,” he says with a wink, gesturing to his pecs.

“What? Secure the perimeter? Why does anyone need to secure the perimeter?” I ask with air quotes and turn to Mr. Tibbs. “What the heck is going on? What are you keeping from me?”

“Ummmm, I’m going to grab something and go.” Torin says with a great deal of uncertainty.

“Calm down, Raven, it’s just a precaution; Torin will be joining Tiern to ensure that the wards Nemus put up are holding.” Mr. Tibbs says.

“Just a precaution against what, the Formorians, the Morrigan? What wards? What are you not telling me? Spill it, and I mean now!” I snap, barely containing my anger. “I just let Daphne go home, is she safe there? I need to know what we’re dealing with– I can’t lose another member of my family right now. She’s all I have left.”

“Torin, secure the perimeter and then report back here to me. Raven, I need you to calm down as we have much to discuss. I had hoped that maybe this evening I could give you a reprieve, but now I see that I shouldn’t. I sought to protect you from this and I apologize,” Mr. Tibbs says with remorse, taking my hand.

“Okay, we’re going to start with what a kindred is, and what it means to be kindred. Then we’ll move to the mating bond, and after that we’ll move on to ‘secure the perimeter,’ and how all that factors in.” I say with more aggravation than necessary. “Seriously, I can’t believe you were trying to keep this from me. You had to have known that I would find out about this!”

He stalks toward me, so very serious, and says in a low growl, “I will always put you first, and I will always protect you, so don’t be angry at me for that.”

I jab a finger into his chest and say, “Start talking, then. I need to know what is going on and why you feel the need to protect me from this.” I gesture wildly around, knowing that I’m behaving irrationally, but unable to help it.

“Raven, we are a mated pair,” Mr. Tibbs begins, running a hand through his hair. He takes my hand and leads me to the back door, and I willingly go. “To be kindred means to be mated; we are soul mates.”

As he says this, he leads me to my favorite spot by the brook. “I knew from the moment I laid eyes on you as a babe that we were destined to be together. The person I suspect to be your mother was not very happy. I was chosen to be your guardian for the journey ahead. Then when I looked upon you, well, I can’t describe how I felt at that moment.”

We walked to the small bridge and all of the tiki torches were aflame, lighting our way, making the setting somewhat magickal.

“It almost brought me to my knees. Unlike humans, once we find our kindred we never look back, because at that moment all is right in the world. It didn’t matter that you were just an infant; as we looked at one another our bond kicked in. Your tiny little hands reached out to me, and once you were placed in my arms you settled against my heart and our bond began to strengthen. Unfortunately, as your guardian, I was tasked with hiding you in the Mortal Realm until the time of your awakening. Then a very powerful enchantment was placed on you so that you would appear human and grow up as a human child. It was important to the goddess that you remain hidden. During this time, all I could do was keep tabs on you. You were never to be without your talisman. Your awakening was supposed to be a smooth transition, not like what you experienced earlier this morning.” He pulls me into his embrace, and I willingly go to him, needing to be near him.

I take a few minutes to process what he said, and then I lift my head to observe my surroundings. I love the night sounds. The cicadas and tree frogs engaged in their serenades. Fireflies are everywhere and the soft light of the tiki torches gently bathe the clearing in a romantic light. I sigh heavily.

“Were you terribly disappointed when you realized that you would have to wait eighteen years for me to grow up? I can’t imagine what you thought when you realized that your kindred had just been born? I don’t even know how old you are. I figured we were roughly the same age but that’s not the case. You have an authoritative air about you, but it just sunk in that you’re much older than I am. I must seem so young and immature to you,” I say, hanging my head uncertainly.

Mr. Tibbs places a finger under my chin, and gently pulls my head until I’m looking into his sapphire eyes. “Make no mistake; I have never once been disappointed that you are mine. You were a beautiful babe, and you have grown into the most amazing young woman. You’re mine, and I am yours. Things happen for a reason. For you, eighteen years have passed, but in Faerie, time runs slower. Every day in the Realm of Faerie is fourteen days in the Mortal Realm. Although I would travel here from time to time to check on you, only a total of a year and a half has passed in Faerie since you were placed here to grow into the young woman you are today.”

“Oh, shut the front door!” I exclaim. “I think I need to sit.”

Mr. Tibbs chuckles. “It really was a stroke of genius for the goddess to send you to the Mortal Realm. It enabled you to grow up at a natural rate but still be there when Faerie needed you as a young adult. I am more than thankful for that decision. Velma and Harley made sure to keep me informed, as did Freya and quite a few others. I have been to all of your birthdays – going unnoticed thanks to Nemus’ glamour – but I was there.”

With a grimace he adds, “I was even here to see you off for your prom.”

“Oh, my goodness, really? How embarrassing. You do know that nothing happened and I was home before midnight, right?” I say with my head in my hands, looking through my fingers.

“Yes, that is the only reason why he still breathes,” Mr. Tibbs says with a smirk.

“Now I know why I’ve never really felt drawn to any of the guys at school. My prom date and I are just friends, after all. All the girls would go on and on about this guy or that, and I could have cared less. It’s always been you that I’ve been missing. So that pull that I feel for you, how does that work?” I ask as I settle into him. The longer we’re alone together, the stronger the pull has become.

Mr. Tibbs looks down at me with a slight frown. “What we’re feeling is the mating bond. Sooner rather than later it will demand that we seal the binding. The longer we resist, the stronger the pull will become. I would like to bond with you first, before the bond insists on our mating. But the pull to you has become so very intense, I’m not sure how long we can delay the inevitable.”

He pulls me close and I melt into him, understanding his need to be close.

I breathe him in, looking up at his chiseled face. He takes my breath away. I reach up on my tiptoes and cup his cheek in my hand. “Rational thoughts aside, I know you to be my mate, my kindred, and the half that makes me whole. I feel the pull as you do; it is so very strong. Will it always be like this? I’m so distracted that I have trouble concentrating on anything else. I don’t want this feeling to ever, ever, leave me, but how can I worry about anything else when all I can concentrate on is you?”

“The only way to do that is to become one with one another.” Mr. Tibbs says as a blush appears high on his cheeks.

Hiding my smirk, I say in a mocking gasp, “You mean sex?”

Mr. Tibbs lets out an uncomfortable chuckle. “Yes!”

“My handsome elf-man, you have had sex before, correct?”

Mr. Tibbs looks away from me and with a heavy sigh, says something unexpected. “Actually, no. Since I was very young, I’ve always believed that I would meet my kindred. I have been waiting for you.”

At that moment I can’t help myself as I catapult into his arms.

“I’m not sure that I deserve you. You waited for me?” I say as I snuggle into his arms. “I love you. I know that we have more to discuss and I was pretty insistent about it earlier, but I’m okay with doing that tomorrow while Daphne is here. For now, I’d like to head up to bed. Will you stay with me?” I ask shyly.

Mr. Tibbs studies me for a moment, his feelings for me transparent on his handsome face. “I love you, too, Raven. It feels like I have waited a lifetime to hear those words from you. I will always be by your side from this point forward. So you’re okay with us discussing the perimeter tomorrow?” He asks with a smirk.

“Yes. Now that I’ve calmed down I figure that TNT will report anything out of the ordinary.”

“‘TNT’?”

“Yep, my official nickname for Torin and Tiern. Genius if I do say so myself.” I say with a smirk, but stumble on the path heading back towards the house, my energy finally giving out. “I’m suddenly exhausted. I think I need some sleep.”

We make our way through the house as Torin strolls in the front door.

“The wards hold and nothing looks out of the ordinary. Several of the Sprites here are going to remain on the lookout for anything suspicious and alert us if needed. I suggest we all hit the sack and get some good sleep. It’s been a long couple of days. The time here is messing with me.” he says.

“That’s exactly what we need to do. It’s getting late and tomorrow will be here before we know it,” Mr. Tibbs says as we make our way upstairs. Torin heads toward his assigned room, and Mr. Tibbs and I head to my room.

Once inside, I grab a pair of sleep shorts and a camisole and head into the bathroom. I change quickly and set about to brush my teeth, once again seeing my reflection. Just seeing my reflection is confirmation that I’m not dreaming and all of this has actually happened. I smile at my reflection and then pull my hair out of the ponytail that I had put in early this morning. Quickly, I brush my long mane; it’s more than twice as long as it was before. I’m not really sure I know what to do with it so I just leave it down, tucked behind my newly acquired elf-like ears.

As I exit the bathroom, I see that Mr. Tibbs has stripped down to his boxers and I swallow hard. I can’t help myself as I gawk at his impressive body, all corded muscle and lightly tanned. His muscles bunch and flex with just the slightest movement, and I just stand there transfixed to the spot, mesmerized as he moves to pull down the covers to the bed, readying it for us. My word, how is it possible for someone to be so undeniably beautiful. His physique is not something that I have ever encountered, and I find that I’m speechless.

He looks up at me with a smirk, seeing that I’m essentially drooling over him in his boxers. “Tonight we sleep; there’s much to do tomorrow. Come on, Beautiful.” I take his hand as we both crawl into bed together. This is definitely a first for me, and I don’t know what to do.

He senses my discomfort and pulls me in close to him. “I really like your sleeping clothes. The chocolate silk and pink lace is a tantalizing combination. Who knew?”

I chuckle as I relax into him. My head on his chest, I find the rhythmic beating of his heart calming, and he wraps his arms around me and pulls me in. “We’ll talk about the whole perimeter issue tomorrow when Daphne gets here. I’m just so exhausted I can’t keep my eyes open a moment longer.”

He kisses the top of my head and as I drift off, and I think I hear him say, “I’ve got you, Raven.”
