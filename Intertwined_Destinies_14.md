# #14 [Raven]

As I hop in the shower and get myself ready for the day, I can’t help but think what a real piece of work my biological mother turned out to be. I sigh heavily as I dry my hair, which takes no time at all. My hair would have been frizzy and unruly before, but now I find that it takes very little effort to tame. It must be an elf thing or maybe a demi-goddess thing? I have no idea, but I like it. 

I again pull it into a high ponytail and then braid a section, wrapping it securely around the base of the ponytail, giving it a more polished look. I pull on a black dress and zip it up in the back. It’s sleeveless and fitted with a scoop neck in the front, and a deeper scoop neck in the back. I then realize I fill the top out more than I had before. I’m just a little embarrassed by the cleavage that I’m sporting. The skirt is fitted just below my hips and then flares to just above my knees. My mother loved this dress and had insisted I purchase it, saying that every young woman needed a basic black dress in their wardrobe. 

I smile to myself and wonder what she would think about my new look. I look down and see that the pendant on my necklace is nestled between my breasts. Mom had a pair of matching earrings made some time ago, and I decided to wear them today. I rarely wear them because I’m afraid of losing them. They’re an almost exact replica with the diamond and amber inlaid stones and they dangle from my ears. I slip on my black peep stiletto heels and survey myself in the mirror. 

My eyes look huge on my face, and I realize I will never need to use make-up on my face again if I don’t want to. There is really no need; my lashes are so thick it looks as if I’m wearing eyeliner. Mascara is no longer a necessity. I decide on just a bit of lip gloss, and I’m done. I think my mother would be proud to call me her daughter. With yet another sigh, I make my way towards the hall and the stairs to meet up with everyone to get this day underway. I feel old beyond my years as I think about all that needs to be done and all that needs to be discussed and all that I need to learn. About that time my stomach rumbles loudly, so yeah, I can’t wait to see what Velma has prepared for breakfast.


Rounding the corner I see my Elf-man first. He’s so handsome in his suit and tie. As I take him in, I notice that he is seriously checking me out too. Now I can’t help the blush that creeps up my cheeks and the smile that curves my lips. I walk up to him and take his tie in my hand and pull him down to whisper, “Like what you see?”

He chuckles and says, “You could say that. You look beautiful.”

“Thank you. You’re very handsome yourself.” I pull back as the aroma of breakfast hits me and I look at the spread of food and exclaim, “Velma, you made all of Daphne and I’s favorites!”

The front door opens and Daphne and her crew walk in. She looks reserved, quiet and withdrawn. At that moment she is my number one priority. I step toward her and pull her into a tight embrace and whisper, “We can do this together.”

She shakes her head, “But you’re going to leave me here. I had plenty of time last night to think about all that we learned. You’re not from here. Not from this realm and you’re going to leave. I don’t want you to leave me behind when you go.”

I pull away and look deep into her eyes as I try to reassure her, “the only way I’m leaving you behind is if you ask to stay here. If you’re up for this adventure with me then nothing will stop us, ok?”

Daphne clutches me tight and nods her head. “I’m going with you. There’s nothing left for me here. This is our home, but it won’t be a home without you.”

“Then it’s agreed. We stay together, right, Trixie?”

Trixie flutters about. “We’ve always been sisters, so where one goes the other goes.”

I pull back from our hug. “Do you feel better about everything now? I know that it’s a lot to take in, and we have a lot to do, but I wouldn’t dream of doing any of this without you; either of you.” I pause before bouncing to another topic like a ping pong ball. “I’m famished, you ready for some breakfast, sis? Velma has made all of our favorites this morning...” During the exchange I notice Elrond is practically glued to her side, and for whatever reason, I don’t believe he would have left her behind either and I give him a quick smile.

With that we all sit down to eat. We have a little bit of time, so we briefly catch Daphne and everyone else up on the evening events before moving on to my hot topic from last night. 

“Although my biological mother has turned out to be a royal pain in the butt–” I bite the rest off as my Elf-man squeezes my knee. “What? I’m allowed to think what I want about her character. She was overbearing, rude, and completely insensitive. Her treatment of me was more like that of an object or a dog, and not a person, and I quote ‘you are too important to all the Realms…’ No thought was given to what I’ve been through. Just do this when I say so and go here when I say so. You were there for the last half of our conversation, you know I’m right.” I say, knowing I sound like a child.

“That’s why I’m pulling my uncle into the mix of things. He’s the only one in Faerie that is her equal and in some regards even ranks higher than she does.” My Elf-man says and I instantly feel just a bit better.

“Okay, next topic. What’s up with TNT and their outing last night to secure the perimeter business?” I ask, giving my Elf-man a pointed look.

“My brother and I were out last night. I know not of this TNT that you speak of.” Torin speaks up as he goes to get another muffin, several more pieces of bacon, and another slice of quiche. I have no idea where he puts all the food that he is eating. He’s working on his third helping.

“I see you’re busy maintaining your amazing physique, Torin,” I say with a smirk.

“Hey, a guy’s gotta do what a guy’s gotta do, right? Wouldn’t want to disappoint the ladies,” he says with a cheeky grin and a wink in the ladies’ direction. Trixie snorts and shakes her head and Daphne and I both laugh out loud.

My Elf-man just shakes his head as he takes my hand and says, “You both have been officially dubbed TNT by Raven, it’s your new official nickname.”

“But what’s ‘TNT’,” Tiern asks around a mouthful of food; the two of them are like two peas in a pod, and I smirk as I watch the two devour their meal.

“TNT is a type of explosive and we’re getting off topic. We need to wrap this up quickly as we need to head out soon.”

Once the table quiets down Elf-man continues. “We have reason to believe that the Fomorians may be in this realm looking for you. Danu was correct when she said that you were relevant to all the realms, you may be the key to saving the Tree of Life. We won’t know for sure until you begin to come into your abilities. This is a discussion that I wanted to save for later because I knew that you would have questions, but for now know that the Fomorians will not care if you are the key or not, they only know that you are a potential threat to their mission and therefore will not wait for you come into your abilities,” he says very seriously, all the while running gentle circles over my wrist with his thumb.

“So they would eliminate me if given the opportunity? That’s what you’re saying and why my biological mother bound you to me as a guardian. As long as the glamor holds I would not need your protection, but now that the awakening has taken place, I do.” I say as if some kind of light bulb has just come on in my head. “They want me dead, and it’s your job to protect me. That means that you’ll be throwing yourself between me and anything that comes after me, right?” 

I’m growing more and more agitated by the moment as I realize what this means. “No! All this has gotten really messed up. I love you, Elf-man. I will not have you or anyone else on this team throwing themselves between me and whatever danger that might be lurking around out there. I won’t have it, Elf-man,” I say as I pull his face up to look me in the eye.

“Raven, it’s my duty and my guards’ duty,” he points around the table, “to protect you. My men have been training for a long time just for missions like this. Even my druids have been trained in self-defense. This is the reason that Torin and Tiern will eat you out of house and home,” he said laughing and trying to make light of the situation.

“Hey,” Daphne interrupts. “Raven and I have been trained in self-defense... Most of our teenage life has been spent in some form of training. We’ve had years of karate, and some tae kwon do, we have done archery and we have always gone to the shooting range for target practice. All we would need to do is refresh. After that you guys could teach us how to use short swords, daggers, and maybe staves. We would still be doing it all as a team and it would be fun. What do you think, Raven?”

“I agree, Daphne. So it is settled,” I say as I look at each one of them. “As soon as our business here is finished we will make our way to the Otherworld and start training. Daphne and I could probably even put a rush on things here so we can leave as soon as possible.” Daphne nods in agreement. “We’ll begin training in self-defense when we get home today. I’ll not have my sister or I being caught in a situation where we are unable to defend ourselves.” I hear two very resounding no’s coming from my Elf-man and Elrond. 

“What do you mean ‘no’?” Daphne and I reply at the same time.

Elf-man looks at me and declares, “It’s my duty to protect you.” He has officially gone all cavemen mode on me. I can feel Elrond is right there with him.

“Protect away, Elf-man. Protect us while we’re training. Daphne and I both need to be able to protect ourselves if push comes to shove; I’d much rather we all be prepared.”

“Absolutely,” Daphne agrees, giving Elrond a questioning look. “My sister and I have been training together for years. What’s the difference? You all carry daggers and swords so we’ll need to learn how to handle those in combat. It’s the only thing we haven’t taken so far. Raven, we might even need some endurance training as well so we can build stamina, right?”

I look around the table to see several shocked faces and smirk. “Yep, you bet, Sis. As soon as we get home let’s start with archery. That won’t be a problem. We can start there and have the guys assess our skill level. We can meet up at the shooting range for some target practice after that. I’m actually excited about this now.”

“Wait, I have not agreed to this,” my Elf-man says with a huff.

“I don’t care if you agree or not. My sister is the only one that needs to agree with me and she already has. If you and Elrond don’t agree I’m sure we can get TNT on board. I have no doubt they’ll enjoy showing off their mad skills, right guys?” I ask, smiling sweetly at the two of them. 

“It should be fun, right, guys?” Daphne chimes in, winking at the guys. They stare at us, not knowing what to think.

About this time Elrond pounds on the table with his fist and says, “I will not allow it. It’s my duty to protect you, Daphne. I will not allow you to throw yourself into danger.” He turns his smoldering eyes to her, barely able to contain his outraged anger at the thought of Daphne training with TNT.

So now Daphne loses it. “I’m so tired of this kind of behavior from you. If you don’t like it, you can come aboard and help! But you have no say over what I can and can’t do, do you understand me? Why are you going all Neanderthal on me? It’s *training*, for goodness sakes! With my sister! I’m not throwing myself off a cliff, so get over yourself. My sister and I have agreed to train and that’s what we’re going to do!” She yells as she gets up from the table and storms out of the room. “And I don’t need anyone else’s blessing!” 

Velma gives the guys an evil stare and her and Harley take off behind Daphne.

This whole time Trixie has been oddly quiet, taking in the entire scene. Now she gets up and her graceful, silvery wings start fluttering. My attention shifts to her as she brings herself eye level with the rest of us.

“You men are all acting like Neanderthals and have gone all ‘cave men’ on these young women. Shame on you! If you would stop and think for one nanosecond you would know that they are right. They deserve to be given the chance and opportunity to have the knowledge and skills they’ll need to protect themselves as well as other people of the realms. Everyone in this room, including Daphne,” she says glaring at Elrond, “have become key players in what is to come. So get your heads out of your butts and stop acting like cavemen. Don’t you dare hold these young women back because if you do, you will fail them! Have I made myself clear?” she says irately with authority that I have never heard from her before. Then I hear her mumble under her breath. ”What a bunch of stupid men! The testosterone in this room is off the charts. What do they think women are good for anyways? We can’t all stay at home barefoot and pregnant. Some of us have realms to save.” She continues to mutter to herself as she flutters out of the room in search of Daphne
.
“That went well...” I say with a cheeky grin. Then I look at my Elf-man and see that he has become very quiet and is staring down at his hands. I reach out to take his hands in mine. “I’ll be ok. I understand that this might be hard for you, but it’s for the best. If you don’t feel like you can train me, then I’m sure that Torin and Tiern won’t mind stepping up. I need to do this, Elf-man. I need to be able to fight my own battles and know that I am not a liability to you... I would never forgive myself if something happened to you because of me, and right now I’m your Achilles heel.” I say softly looking down at his strong hands.

“You’re right. We begin when we get back, and I’ll oversee yours and Daphne’s training. Elrond, I will speak to you in private before we begin,” he concedes. Then, looking back at me, he lowers his forehead to mine and says, “We do this together or not at all, understand?”

I breathe him in and say, “Together!”
