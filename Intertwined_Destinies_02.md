# #02 [Raven]

Like in my dreams, landscapes and scenery flash by, and then there’s a feeling of being sucked in a vacuum before I pass through to the other side. In the blink of an eye, I soon find myself in a beautiful meadow. I feel as if I’m actually here, physically, although I know I’m not. I shake my head and look around, trying to get my bearings; this place is secluded and breathtaking.

I believe I’ve been here before, in my dreams, but I shake it off. My tether feels stretched, taut, but it begins to relax the longer I’m here, as if adjusting to where I’ve traveled.

“Hello,” I call out. “Is there anyone here? Please, someone be here. Anyone?”

I mutter more to myself, “I should’ve known this wasn’t going to work out…” and, frustrated, I stomp my feet.

“Hey, lady, are you always this loud?” A quiet voice says. “Some of us are trying to sleep around here.”

“Who’s there?” I spin around but don’t see anyone. “Please? I’m sorry to wake you but I’m looking for someone and was hoping I could find some help down here.”

“Aren’t we all?” I hear the smile in her question.

“Seriously, is that the best you’ve got? I mean, really? I’m looking for a guy that I was told would meet me down here.”

“Duh, who isn’t?” The voice comes from the shore of a pond to my left.

“I believe we’ve met here before in my dreams – or at least I think it was in my dreams – and I feel like he can help me.” I continue to look around but have yet to see another person. “Will you please show yourself? I just need…”

I sigh, hating that I sound like such a helpless child. “That’s the problem, I don’t know what I need or what’s going on, but I think the man from my dreams may be able to help.”

I hear giggling and I catch sight of what can only be a faerie, bent over from laughing behind a large rock near the water. “So, you are looking for the man of your dreams to come solve all of your problems for you? Huh? Wow, that’s rich,” she says, continuing to giggle.

She’s only maybe six inches tall with silvery wings, long wavy hair that reaches almost to her feet so dark black that I see midnight blue highlights. She has brilliant crystal blue, twinkling eyes in the setting of faerie-like features with the most luminous complexion I have ever seen. Her skin looks like it sparkles in the sunlight. Suddenly she is up and fluttering her wings until she is hovering right in front of my face.

“Mr. Tibbs has asked those of us who live here to let him know of any odd or unusual things, but I don’t recall Mr. Tibbs ever saying anything about someone like you. Can you describe your dream man to me? Does he have a name?” she asked, trying to stifle another giggle.

In my effort to be civil, I say, “You are very pretty, are you a sprite? By the way my name is Raven. What’s yours?”

I shuffle my feet, looking around and hoping to see Mr. Tibbs. As soon as she had uttered his name, I knew – that’s who I’m looking for. I can’t help glancing around the meadow for him, but he’s nowhere to be found and I’m stuck with this feisty faerie.

“My name? Are you sure you want my name? And no, I am not a sprite, I am a faerie.”

“Why? Are there rules about asking faeries’ names?” I ask, running through all the Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings movies in my head.

She laughs again. “No, no rules. I’m just playing around with you. My name is Trixie. My friends here call me ‘Trix’.” She spins her head to the side as she addresses me with her hands on her hips. Her silvery, glittering wings flutter behind her, and her light blue mini-dress hugs her curves. She really is quite beautiful, even if she is only six inches tall. She’s honestly the size of those Tinkerbell dolls one would find at Walmart, and I can’t help the smile that slides into place.

“It’s really nice to meet you, Trixie. So, Mr. Tibbs? Where might I find him?” I’m growing restless because I know my time here is short; I can feel it in my tether. For a time it was relaxed, but now it’s beginning to pull tight and I’m not sure how much longer I have. “I really need to talk to him. Can you help me, Trix?”

Trix considers my request for a moment before coming to a decision. “Mr. Tibbs visits here often, I could possibly get a message to him.” She takes a good look at me before saying, “You aren’t here physically, are you? And I guess that you’re not from this realm as well, but maybe you should be. That’s a rare ability you have; not many people can astral project and certainly those that can, are not able to jump realms doing so.”

I ponder those words for a moment. *Jump realms?*

But I realize I’ve run out of time, so I quickly file that away.

“Trix, I’m running short on time,” I say frantically. “Can you get a message to Mr. Tibbs? Can you tell him that Raven is looking for him, and that I’m in trouble? There’s been an accident, and I’m trapped in a dark place, completely void of any light. It feels like a cage, and the walls are pressing in on me. It’s like I’m trapped in my body but not–”

Frustrated with myself, I groan, taking a deep breath as I gather my thoughts. I’m not explaining this very well – I can’t see what’s going on or why I’m unable to wake up.

“Heck, you’re talking about realms as if this isn’t planet Earth. Obviously it isn’t because we don’t have faeries where I come from, at least I don’t think so–” Now I’m rambling.

“Trix, please? You may be my only hope. I know somewhere deep down, like a forgotten memory, that Mr. Tibbs may be the only one to help me. I’m not sure if I’ll be able to come back; I’ll try, but this isn’t like my dream-walking. This is the only time I’ve been able to visit this place when I haven’t been dreaming.”

Before I can think about it any further, I belt out. “Tell Mr. Tibbs it’s time. Tell Mr. Tibbs I need my guardian for my awakening!”

Trix looks at me with eyes wide in alarm, and then she says, “Yes, my Lady! I will find him.”

Suddenly the tether pulls taut like a rubber band stretched too far, and I’m flying backward, but before I go I manage to say, “Thank you, Trixie – I owe you one.”

Then I’m flying back the way I came, back to my body, back to Earth. The scenery flies by at an incredible speed until I’m hovering over my prone form.

Daphne is still at my side, but now she has a book in her hands and she’s reading to me. She is reading about……

My body lies deathly still against the stark white sheet of the hospital bed. Daphne looks pretty banged up with a huge bandage around her head and one of her legs set in a cast. She may be my niece, and the only family I have left, but with only a year’s difference in age between us she’s also one of my closest friends. Suddenly feeling drained, I’m pulled back into my body.

What once felt like a welcome cocoon has now become my prison.
