# #02 [Morgan]

Like in my dreams, landscapes and scenery flash by, and then there’s a feeling of being sucked in a vacuum before I pass through to the other side. In the blink of an eye, I soon find myself in a beautiful meadow. I feel as if I’m actually here, physically, although I know I’m not. I shake my head and look around, trying to get my bearings; this place is secluded and breathtaking.

I believe I’ve been here before, in my dreams, but I shake it off. My tether feels stretched, taut, but it begins to relax the longer I’m here, as if adjusting to where I’ve traveled.

“Hello,” I call out. “Is there anyone here? Please, someone be here. Anyone?”

I mutter more to myself, “I should’ve known this wasn’t going to work out…” and, frustrated, I stomp my feet.

“Hey, lady, are you always this loud?” A quiet voice says. “Some of us are trying to sleep around here.”

“Who’s there?” I spin around but don’t see anyone. “Please, I’m sorry to wake you but this is an emergency. I really do need help.”

“Seriously, is that the best you’ve got? I mean, really?"

“I’m looking for a guy I was told would meet me here.” 

“Duh, who isn’t?” The voice comes from the shore of a pond to my left.

“I believe we’ve met here before, in my dreams -- or at least I think it was in my dreams -- and I feel like he can help me.” I continue to look around but have yet to see another person. “Will you please show yourself? I just need…”

I sigh. “I know I must sound like a whiny, helpless child. I don’t know what I need besides this man’s help.”

I hear giggling and I catch sight of what can only be a faerie, bent over from laughing behind a large rock near the water. “So, you are looking for the man of your dreams to come solve all of your problems for you? Huh? Wow, that’s rich,” she says, continuing to giggle. "Aren't we all?"

She’s only maybe six inches tall with silvery wings, long wavy hair that reaches almost to her feet so dark black that I see midnight blue highlights. She has brilliant crystal blue, twinkling eyes in the setting of faerie-like features with the most luminous complexion I have ever seen. Her skin looks like it sparkles in the sunlight. Suddenly she is up and fluttering her wings until she is hovering right in front of my face.

“Brody has asked those of us who live here to let him know of any odd or unusual things, but I don’t recall Brody ever saying anything about someone like you. Can you describe your dream man to me? Does he have a name?” 

“Yes! Yes! I knew I would know the name as soon as I heard it.”

“Oh, right. Sure, sure. I think you are grasping for straws now. He didn’t tell me anyone would come looking for him.”

“I’m sorry, I haven’t even introduced myself. My name is Morgan. You are a very beautiful faerie; I just love your hair color. What’s your name?” The whole time I’m shifting my feet looking around to see if I can spot Brody. I’m so tired of being in limbo and Fiona really needs me right now. As soon as the faerie uttered his name I knew -- *that’s* the guy I'm looking for. I just can’t stop glancing around, but he is nowhere to be found and I’m stuck with this feisty faerie.

“My name?"

“Are there rules about asking faeries’ names?” I ask, running through all the Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings movies in my head.

She laughs again. “No, no rules. I’m just playing around with you. My name is Trixie. My friends here call me ‘Trix’.” She spins her head to the side as she addresses me with her hands on her hips. Her silvery, glittering wings flutter behind her, and her light blue mini-dress hugs her curves. She really is quite beautiful, even if she is only six inches tall. She’s honestly the size of those Tinkerbell dolls one would find at Walmart, and I can’t help the smile that slides into place.

“It’s really nice to meet you, Trix. So Brody -- where might I find him?” I’m growing restless because I know my time is short; I can feel it in my tether. For a time it was relaxed but now it’s beginning to pull tight and I’m not sure how much longer I have. ”I really need to talk to him. I guess he has been my guardian since I was an infant. I need my guardian for my awakening. I’m really running out of time,” I say frantically. “I need him to know that I’m in serious trouble. There’s been an accident and I’m trapped in a dark place completely void of light. It feels like a cage, and the walls are pressing in on me. It’s like I’m trapped in my own body but not."

Frustrated with myself, I groan, taking a deep breath as I gather my thoughts. I know I must sound crazy and I’m probably not explaining this right. I can’t see what’s going on or why I’m unable to wake up. “Trix, please; you may be my only hope. I know I have many forgotten memories but I’m not sure I’ll be able to come back.” 

All the sudden I just belt out, “Brody, it’s time! I need my guardian for my awakening!”

Trix looks up at me with eyes wide in alarm, and then she says, “Yes, my lady, I will find him.” But before she says more the sound of a stampede approaching startles us. Then I see Brody, and slew of other men following him, heading our way.

Suddenly the tether pulls tight like a rubber band stretched too far and I’m starting to fly backward. “Morgan, no!” Trix yelled. I stopped but only for an instant.

“Morgan, where can I find you?" Brody yells, looking at me like I'm not real. "It’s not time yet, you shouldn’t experience your awakening for another few months yet. How is it that you even know about this?”

Tears are streaming down my face. “Everything changed suddenly. I died in a car accident and they brought me back, now I can’t wake up! I’m stuck and I’m fading fast. I don’t know how else to explain it but I need you.”

“What accident, Morgan?”

“I’m in a hospital somewhere in the Smokies, off of I-75,” I add quickly, knowing I'm talking too fast, but can’t stop. “A terrible accident happened and I’m disconnected from my body.”

I look up to see Trix hovering near my face, and she reaches up and wipes my tears as I put my arm around her. “Morgan, you're fading too fast now. Just go back now, dear. I will get them there. I promise.”

Then I’m flying back the way I came, back to my body, back to Earth.  The scenery flies by at an incredible speed until I’m hovering over my prone form.
