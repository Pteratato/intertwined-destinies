# #07 [Raven]

I’m breathing heavily. My body is still in turmoil as I struggle to adjust to what happened, but then I open my eyes to see his brilliant sapphire eyes looking back at me. It’s at that moment that I realize I’m lying on top of him and his arms are wrapped around me, securing me to his chest. I look up at him through my lashes, and then slowly wrap my arms around him, pulling him closer, savoring his smell and his feel. I quickly lose myself in him as I snuggle closer to his chest, my breathing heavy as if I’ve just run a marathon. Just being held by him calms my jagged nerve endings. I could get lost in this feeling; it’s like nothing that I have ever experienced before. I lay my head on his chest and close my eyes, sighing in contentment, feeling like I’ve finally come home. The pull I feel toward Mr. Tibbs is nothing short of magick, and I would be content in his arms forever.

“Mmhmm, I don’t mean to interrupt but as sweet as this little reunion has turned out to be, we should probably get going.” I hear a male say voice over my shoulder – Elrond.

”I think we can give Raven some time to get her bearings.” Mr. Tibbs’ voice rumbles through his chest as he pulls me in tighter. “She’s been through a lot and needs time to adjust. Raven, how are you feeling?” He asks as he gently strokes my hair and kisses the tip of my head.

”I feel like I’ve known you for a thousand years, but we’ve only just met, how is that possible?” I blurt out. “How is it that I dreamt of you for weeks before the accident? What just happened to me? I feel different. I don’t know how, but I do.”

I’m aware that I’m rambling but can’t seem to stop, and all the while I can’t let go of Mr. Tibbs, clinging to him like a vine.

“We have a lot to discuss.” Mr. Tibbs says as he puts a finger under my chin, lifting my face to his. “First, why don’t we see if you can stand? Then I’ll have Trixie assist you in getting cleaned up, we can get everyone fed, and I can see to Daphne’s injuries while you shower. Do you trust me? Before you see yourself in your true form, I need you to know that you have never looked more beautiful to me than you do at this moment.”

I nod as the realization hits; I trust him implicitly.

I have been so focused on Mr. Tibbs that I’d forgotten Daphne. How could I forget her? I whip my head around and look at Daphne sitting quietly in her wheelchair, taking everything in, a handsome man standing behind her with his hand resting on her shoulder.

“Oh…my… gosh! Daphne, are you okay? I’m so sorry that I haven’t been here for you.” I stumble forward on wobbly legs, reaching for her, and Mr. Tibbs helps steady me. I’m down on my knees in front of her and I take all of her in; her auburn hair hangs in soft curls around her face and reaches more than midway down her back. Her emerald eyes are large and shimmering with unshed tears. Her skin is fair with a light dusting of tiny freckles over her nose. She and I have always been on the petite side, both standing about five feet. The bandage around her head has been replaced with just a bandage on the right side of her forehead, her right leg is in a cast, and her right arm in a sling. I place my hand gently on her cheek and repeat my question in a soft voice. “Are you okay?”

Daphne lowers her eyes and looks down at her lap, tears beginning to fall in earnest. I can’t imagine what she has been through since the accident. I reach up to take her in my arms, careful not to squeeze her too tightly.

“Shhh… it’s okay. I’m here now. You’re not alone anymore. I’m so sorry.” I say as I begin to cry right along with her. Our grief rolls out of us for all that we have lost. We both stay that way, just clinging to one another and crying until we can’t cry anymore. “We’re going to be okay, you and me. Whatever happens from this point forward, we’re a team, okay?”

I pull back and look into her tear-streaked face and for the first time, I notice the uncomfortable silence in the room as the men shuffle their feet from side to side. I look at each of the men and ask “What? Have you never seen two grown women cry before? Seriously, you’d think we grew horns or something.”

“I knew I liked you, Raven; you have spunk. These guys aren’t going to know what hit them.” Trixie says. Then, looking between Daphne and me, she adds on a more serious note; “I look forward to getting to know the both of you. I think that we’re going to be spending a lot of time together.”

She lands on my shoulder and latches on to my hair to steady herself as I pull back to look at Daphne.

Daphne looks at me with wide eyes. “What was that, Raven? You look different. Wow, you’re beautiful – not that you weren’t before, but now, just wow. You’ve changed. You have this pixie-like look to your features, and your hair has this shine about it. I don’t want to spoil the surprise, so I’m not gonna say anything more until you have had a chance to see for yourself. And, Raven, don’t beat yourself up for not being here for me after the accident. You couldn’t help what happened anymore than I could. You’re here now and that’s what matters. We can face the rest together. I’ve missed you.” She says with a wistful smile and squeezes my hand. Then she looks up at the handsome druid that has not yet left her side, and her smile widens.

If I didn’t know better, I would think there was something here between the two of them. I’ll have to ask Mr. Tibbs about that later. About that time I feel Mr. Tibbs helping me to my feet and turning me to face him. He surveys my face with a tiny frown and gently wipes the remainder of my tears away with his calloused thumb.

“You okay?”

I nod, and then he says, “Torin, Tiern, I need you to round up some food for all of us; dawn is approaching and we have much to do in the days to come before we can head back to the Otherworld. Nemus, can you see to Daphne’s injuries? Trixie, I need you to help Raven get cleaned up.”

“Whoa there, mister, I know you like to give orders and I know you mean well and all, but I think I can manage in the bathroom on my own. No offense, Trixie, I’m really not sure just how much help you would be. Besides, I have a feeling I will need some time to myself. A lot has happened and I need to see these changes myself.” I say to Mr. Tibbs and Trixie.

He gives me a long hard look and then asks, “Are you sure? You can barely stand.”

“I can manage.” Looking at this elf man in front of me, it’s almost as if I can sense what he’s feeling. He looks so unhappy that I can’t stop myself from lifting my hand to caress his cheek. “I’ll be fine. If I need any help, I’ll let you know. I’m just going to be in the connecting bathroom; it’s not like you won’t be able to hear me.”

He’s not happy, but he relents, “Alright, don’t push yourself, promise? It will take a few days to get your strength back”

“Are you going to hover the whole time? Because we may have a problem if that’s the case – just saying.” I add with a smirk.

“You are doggone straight I’m going to hover. I almost lost you, so you had better get used to having a permanent shadow. I’m going to stick to you like glue.” And with that, he pulls me tight against him. Against my will I feel myself melt into him and with a chuckle, he says, “Alright, Miss Independent, get to it, time’s a wastin’.”

I look up at him; he towers over me, and I guess his height to be somewhere around 6’2”, his cocking smirk showing off his adorable dimple and I just roll my eyes. “So cocky…”

I hear a male voice behind me say with a smile to his tone, “This should be interesting.”

I turn away from Mr. Tibbs to gather some clothes out of the tiny hospital closet, and with a sigh I enter the bathroom on shaky legs to discover the new me.
