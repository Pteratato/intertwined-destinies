
#12 [Raven]

This sensation has become familiar to me now. It’s as if my subconscious has a mind of its own and I’m pulled away. 

Doggone it, this really makes me mad. I badly need a good night’s rest to handle everything tomorrow, not to be floating around outside my body. I’m not sure why I’m being pulled away from Mr. Tibbs. 

My ethereal body flies at a high rate of speed and once again I find myself in the beautiful, secluded meadow. The tree is just as I left her, and I know now she is the Tree of Life. It’s twilight here and a large moon is rising to light the meadow, reflecting off the water in the lake. As the sky darkens from shades of violet to purple, to midnight, there’s a spectacular display of stars popping out in the night sky. Out to my left I see the children in the pool playing, and I just sit there and watch them for a while. 

They play well together, and they always seem to be happy; is this all there is for them? Is this their daily life? They just swim all the time? Do they eat, do they sleep? Where are their parents? Do they have a home? Who can I talk to about them? 

I really feel drawn to these children. As I sit there pondering, I see a shadow drifting my way. Could this be a parent or relative telling them it’s time to come in for bed? As the shadow gets closer I see an exceptionally beautiful, dark-haired female step out from behind a tree. Her stature is petite and her presence is huge, and I find myself taking a knee with my head bowed as she approaches. Somehow, I know she is not kin to these children.

Her long, flowing copper gown flutters about her in the gentle breeze of the meadow. Like me, her complexion has a slight sparkle to it, and her eyes are almost the same color as mine except with deeper shades of brown. It’s then that I begin to see the similarities between us. Her hair is a dark mahogany, and interwoven with her hair is a simple but beautiful circlet.

“Arise, my daughter; you should never bow to me. It has been too long since I’ve laid eyes on your beautiful countenance. You were just a wee baby then. You are more beautiful than I could have ever dreamed,” she says as she takes me in.

“Who are you? I feel that I should know you, but I do not,” I say, climbing to my feet and feeling undressed in my sleep ensemble. I’m out of my element and wishing Mr. Tibbs was here.

“I am your mother, child, and those children are your future; from a time you have no memory of. I gave you the best chance at survival by sending you to the Mortal Realm. If you had stayed with me, it would have meant your death, and you are too important to all the Realms for that to happen.” She says more matter-of-factly, as if that explains everything to me. No feelings whatsoever. She just kind of blurts it out which stuns me for a minute.

Her unemotional response doesn’t sit well; my mortal mother would have pulled me into her arms and told me that she loved me and missed me. But then, I don’t see this woman as my mother, and perhaps not much of a mother figure to anyone, for that matter.

“As much as I would like a family reunion, my time here is short,” I snap impatiently. “What is it that you want with me? You’re the reason why I’m here and not sleeping like I should be, correct?”

“I see that I have upset you.” she sighs. “That was not my intent. Daughter, you need to be back here in Faerie in two days time to begin your training. This should give you more than a week or so in the Mortal Realm to wrap things up and put your affairs in order.”

I wish again that Mr. Tibbs was here, his presence calms me and I can see that this woman is someone of importance, but this just pissed me off. 

“Why are you so insensitive? In the morning I’m burying my mortal mother. The mother who raised me, the mother *you* sent me to so I could be raised as a human child. Forgive me if I act like the human I was raised to be. I’ve lost every one of my family with the exception of Daphne and my grief is overwhelming. My mother was an amazing woman and she was my rock. I will take as long as I need to ‘wrap things up,’” I say with air quotes.

I feel a familiar calming presence approaching from behind, but I continue my tirade.

“You don’t know– you may be my biological mother, but that’s where this connection ends. You obviously have no sympathy or concern for my feelings on the matter. If you did, you wouldn’t be so heartless,” I fume, and I feel Mr. Tibbs place a calming hand on the small of my back. I lean back into him and then into his embrace, turning my back on this woman.

I take a moment to calm myself as I hear Mr. Tibbs say, “Goddess,” as he inclines his head in greeting, a grim look on his face.

“Wait, what? Goddess?” I look up at Mr. Tibbs with a questioning look on my face. “I’m sorry, did you say goddess?”

“Raven, I believe it’s time to finally meet your mother, High Queen Danu, and the Mother Goddess to all Faerie.” He says as he relinquishes me to get down on one knee in reverence to his queen, head bowed, all the while still holding my hand.

I look back and forth between the two uncertainly. I pull him up to his feet. “What are you saying?” I try to take in the fact that this woman is the equivalent of Mother Nature, and a High Queen to boot, and I’ve just gone off on her. 

“Well, heck,” I mutter under my breath. “I don’t know what the protocol is here. Do I bow, do I curtsey, what?” I rub my free hand over my face and my anger starts to deflate.

“Raven, just be yourself. She’s your mother as well as all the other things. She is my High Queen and therefore I must show her the respect she deserves,” He says as he turns to my mother. “That being said, my Queen, you really could cut Raven some slack. It’s only been twenty-four hours or so in the Mortal Realm since her difficult awakening. In that time, she had had to come to terms with the loss of her family, make funeral arrangements, arrange meetings with the estate attorneys, take in the fact that she is not who she thought she was and come to understand that she and I are kindred and share a mate bond. No offense, but your timing for dropping another bombshell on her is less than perfect. Could this not have waited?” He’s clearly angry, but he places his hand at the small of my back and gently strokes back and forth to reassure me.

She smiles serenely at us and inclines her head toward Mr. Tibbs. “Prince Tibbs, it’s nice to see you again. I expect that you will see to it that my daughter’s virtue remains intact until the binding ceremony? Anything less will not do. I see that you have not been entirely honest with my daughter about your station in Faerie. Maybe you should be less concerned with how and when I drop bombshells on Raven, and be more concerned with the timing of your own.” She snaps icily with a wicked smirk. Clearly she is not a fan of Mr. Tibbs.

“That’s enough,” I snap. “Obviously our first meeting has been strained, to say the least. As for Mr. Tibbs and his station, that is something that I had all but figured out. He is trying to give me time to absorb everything, and I do not fault him for waiting to explain.” I feel him relax next to me.

“Now, please explain why I need to be back in Faerie in two days, as our time draws to a close. I need to know what awaits,” I say as I take Mr. Tibbs’ hand, trying to reassure him that all is well between us.

Danu takes notice and is clearly frustrated with the fates that my kindred is Mr. Tibbs. I have to wonder who she would have preferred to match me with because obviously it’s not him. Not that it matters because I will not let anyone or anything come between us. “I will meet you three days from now at Glendale Loch Keep to begin instruction, followed by your training. That should give you a day to settle in before my arrival. I assume this is your preference, Prince?” She asks. He inclines his head in agreement and she continues. “If I deem your Keep not to be adequate for her safety and training, then she will be relocated to a place of my choosing.”

“Excuse me? I’m standing right here, and I expect to be a part of any decisions that are made in regards to my ‘safety and training.’ I will not be treated as an object that can be shuffled around at your bidding.” I glare at her.

“As you wish, Daughter. I hope that in the days to come we can make peace with one another. I find that I’m clearly out of my element here. It was never my intent to belittle your time with your mortal family, and I apologize if I seem heartless in that regard. I have the utmost respect for the woman who raised such a willful young woman. I wish that I could have thanked her for the care she took with you. May she find peace in the Overworld. I would like the chance to start over with you, Daughter, and would be most grateful if you’d consider giving me the opportunity to get to know you. For now you must return; morning approaches in the Mortal Realm and our time is up.” 

She steps back under the tree and vanishes. Then Mr. Tibbs and I are both quickly pulled back to the Mortal Realm, and we wake in each other’s arms as dawn approaches.
