#15 [Raven]

The day flies by in a blur, and before I know it the brutal services have been concluded. I find that Daphne and I are speaking to our family attorneys and being given letters that have been entrusted to them for this very occasion. They run through each family's will and not surprisingly everything that was in mom’s name has been transferred to me, in the event that Kat was no longer with us. Since Daphne was still under the age of eighteen all her family belongings were put in a trust for her. Both of us are being left very well off, not that it matters where we are heading. No mention of guardianship was made due to the fact that within a matter of months Daphne would turn eighteen. Velma and Harley, Trixie, Mr. Tibbs and his men have all been very supportive, but I sense that both Daphne and I need to be alone with our letters and our thoughts as we get back to the house.

It's early afternoon, and we ask for some alone time. We cross the tiny bridge that spans the width of the brook. We are going in search of the waterfall on the property. Daphne takes my hand, and we walk along quietly for a time. No words are needed. We are both mourning and taking comfort in the other’s presence. There’s a light breeze in the late August afternoon that causes the branches of the trees to stir as we follow the brook. It gradually becomes wider as we get closer to the small secluded waterfall on the property. The letters feel heavy in my hand as we make our way quietly, contemplating the day’s events. I can sense that my Elf-man is close but I choose not to call him out on it. I sigh heavily as I sit in the grass by the water and look over to the spot that Daphne has chosen to sit, some distance away. Both of us need to be alone with our thoughts, even though we’re mourning together. I begin to open the letters and then look up to her. “Are you ready?”

She sighs and nods her head. “I don’t have a choice.”

At that moment I realize that neither one of us have a choice. We need some closure before we can move on. I watch as she bows her head to read the letter she has in her hands and she slowly begins to open it. I switch my focus to the letters in my hands and begin to open the first of my two letters. I chose to read mom’s letter first, and once I see her familiar script time stands still.

*‘My dearest daughter,*

*Raven, you should know by now that I love you with all my heart and I hope that you have always felt that you were mine. Biology does not a relationship make. My love for you was never tied to the flesh; it was your precious soul that called to me. You were my daughter from the moment I laid eyes on you, and you will always be mine no matter what. Please forgive me but I read the letter that your birth mother left for you in the basket all those years ago, and therefore I have always known that you were special, that you were made for greatness. If you are reading this letter then I have passed before I have given you the letter from your birth mother. I had hoped that I would be there for you to read it. I caution you on letting everything that you will learn overwhelm you. I raised you to be kind and thoughtful and to be true to yourself. Embrace that steadfast knowledge that you carry in your heart in knowing the difference between right and wrong. If you can do that, then everything should fall into place.*

*I love you dearest Raven and I am so very thankful that you appeared in my life when you did. You and Daphne will need each other for what is to come. Like you, she is not quite what she appears to be.*

*Remember all things happen for a purpose; I know that you are strong enough to handle whatever the Fates throw your way.*

*With all my love,*

*Mom’*

Sobs rock through me as I read the last of the letter, knowing that the greatest gift that I was given as a child was to be raised by her. My world would never be the same again. I silently cry out to the cosmos, not understanding why she was taken from me. I am so caught up in my sorrow that it takes me a few moments to realize that I am being cradled in his arms. I cry uncontrollably into his embrace. “She’s gone, I miss her so much.”

 “I know; I’ve got you.” He murmurs, just letting me cry. I’m not sure how much time has passed, and when I finally look up, I see that my tears have soaked the front of his shirt. I hear Daphne a little ways away, and look over to see her cradled in Elrond’s arms. She, like me, is caught up in the loss of her family.

“She’s lost so much more than me, and I have been so unsupportive. What’s wrong with me?” I ask. I take a deep breath and look up into my Elf-man’s mesmerizing eyes.

“Why do you say that? You lost your mother, your older sister, your brother–in-law and your nephew. How is her loss greater than yours?” 

“Because I was closest to Mom and Daphne, but not so close to my sister and her husband; my nephew was just younger and I didn’t spend that much time with him. My ties have always been to mom and Daphne. So yes, she has lost so much more than me.” I say quietly, knowing that to be true. “She is so much stronger than me, she always has been. She sees the world from a different perspective than I do and she always has.” 

I think about her for a moment. “In mom’s letter, she said that Daphne is not what she appears. We need Nemus. Maybe he has some thoughts on this. Mom stated that we would need each other for what is to come. I think Daphne will play a key role. I’m not sure how yet. I need to open the letter from Danu next. I thought I wanted to be alone, but will you stay?” I implore my Elf-man as I slowly open the next letter.

*‘Daughter*

*Shortly you will awaken to your true form to embrace your destiny. It was my hope that hiding you away on Earth would keep you out of the clutches of the Fomorians. By doing so, it allowed you time to reach your eighteenth birthday and your awakening, at which point your guardian, Prince Tibbs, will arrive to keep you safe on the journey ahead as you travel back to your homeland of Faerie. Take care to avoid Fomorians as they seek to end your very existence. Hopefully, the glamour placed on you will hold till well after your eighteenth birthday, and as long as the pendant is always on your person, it will keep the awakening at bay until the enchantment is meant to unravel. Be sure to keep that pendant safe and with you at all times. Please know that I have done everything in my power to hide you and keep you safe. I love you, and look forward to meeting the young woman that you will become. I hope that in time, you will be able to forge a bond with me. I will miss you terribly, but will do what I must to keep you safe.*

*Your Mother, Danu’*

“Wow, so mom knew the whole time, and she kept me anyways, even knowing that I could be the reason that the Fomorians could appear on her doorstep if my presence were ever detected. I wonder if she even knew who the Fomorians are. I think I need to talk to Velma and Harley. What do you think?” I ask.

“It sounds like a plan.” He says, pulling me close. Sighing, I look around the area. I take in the tranquil setting and listen to the sound of the water falling on the pool surrounded by trees with the afternoon light filtering from above. 

“Wait, did you see that?” I jump off his lap and run in the direction it came from, my Elf-man following in my footsteps. 

“What did you see?” he questions as he pushes me out of the way. 

“The little red-headed girl from the pool in the meadow, how did she get in this realm?” Elf man sends out a whistle and the whole team is there in seconds as I am pushed further away and told to take care of Daphne. The moment I turn her way she’s already in my arms, shaking. 

“What is it, Raven? Did you hear something?”

“Yeah,” I reply, trying to catch my breath to talk. “It looked like the little red-headed girl that’s always in the swimming pool in Faerie...”

“What girl from what swimming pool, Raven?” Velma asks after running back here because of all the ruckus.  “Come on girls, both of you are coming back to the house with me right now until this is all over.” Velma escorts us back to the house.

“I don’t understand, how did she get in the Mortal Realm?” I mutter, shaking my head in confusion.

Soon the guys are back and Tibbs fills us in. “If someone was there they got out quickly. We have the wards set up again, though, and the property is safe. If you girls need to go out of this house again you use a buddy system. Always take someone else with you just in case. What I really feel, though, is that we need to get you girls to Faerie. You’ll be safer there. I know there is still a lot to do and a lot to discuss but we need to act quickly. Raven, you and I are going to talk about these children and the pool later.” I nod my head.
 
“Yes, unfortunately we need to start putting some of this behind us and begin to move forward now. I know it’s quicker than we had planned but from the sounds of it, it’s a lot safer there. I hear there are four realms that need our help so let’s start training.” I say, looking at Nemus. “We need to start our education and training for the other realms so, yes; there is a lot to do.” 

I watch Elrond stiffen next to Daphne.
“Elrond, thank you for being there for Daphne. I really appreciate the attention you have given her. I just want you to know that all you have done has not gone unnoticed. I appreciate how protective you are of her because she is worth protecting,” I say, watching his reactions.

He shifts close to Daphne and places his hand on the small of her back. “Yes, she is worth protecting. I would give my life in order to keep her safe.” He says as Daphne lifts her gaze towards him. And there you have it.

“Well, let’s hope it doesn’t come to that. I kind of like your brooding presence,” I add with a smirk, pulling my Elf-man with me. I turn so that we can see their faces while I ask over my shoulder, “who wants to wager whether the men can beat me and Daphne in target practice? My Elf-man, how good are you with a bow? Elrond? I think today we can allow the men to go first, what do you think, Daphne?”

“Absolutely, men first, it’ll be our treat.” She says jokingly, even though the guys seem to be on edge.

“Who is ready for a late lunch and then training? I’m famished.” About that time my stomach growls loudly. Laughing, I say, “Come on, let’s get some food then have an afternoon at the practice range.” 

With that we head to the kitchen to find out that Velma knows us better than we know ourselves. She has already set a spread on the table waiting for us to come running.
