# #05 [Mr. Tibbs]

Trixie is on my last nerve – if she bounces up and down one more time, I’m going to duct tape her to the inside of the windshield.

“Will you please, settle down?” I grate out between clenched teeth.

It turns out that both girls were transferred to a hospital in Knoxville. We’re less than ten minutes from reaching our destination according to the GPS navigation system on the dash of our black Hummer. Trixie is hopping around as if she’s overdosed on sugar. Tolin and Tiern are quibbling amongst themselves over who can beat who in a duel using only a staff. Elrond is driving and Nemus, as usual, is sitting quietly off to the side taking everything in. I’m trying to come up with every contingency plan I can just on the off chance we need one. Nemus is going to persuade hospital staff to stay away from Raven’s room for as long as we need so we can see her through her awakening.

As we pull up outside the hospital, I hop out of the vehicle before it’s even parked and make my way to the entrance. As I enter, I stalk toward the information desk. “Raven Nightshade, what room is she in?”

“Are you family? It’s after visiting hours and only family may enter to see her after visiting hours.” The receptionist states with a tight lip grimace.

Her words push me over the edge and I explode. “I demand to see her at once!!” I state as all of my guards gather behind me. I think that I might lose it before Nemus steps forward and very gently persuades the receptionist to give us her room number and buzz us in.

I turn to Nemus, “Thank you. I’m obviously not holding up well. Your cool head and actions are much appreciated.”

As we round the corner in the wing that holds Raven, Nemus sets about persuading the staff to stay away from her room until further notice. Hopefully, his persuasion will last for as long as we need it to to complete Raven’s awakening.

The rest of my men and I enter the room. Daphne gasps and looks around, rapidly taking in the intrusion and its meaning. “Who are you and what are you doing here?” She demands.

I hold up my hands in a conciliatory posture. “Daphne, my name is Mr. Tibbs and we mean you no harm. We’re here to help. We’re going to bring her back to you, to us. I know there is a lot to ask, but you have to trust me. Trust us.”

“How would I know that? How can you prove that you mean us no harm?” Daphne demands.

“Daphne, this is going to sound crazy, but Raven came to me in what I would describe as a dream-like state and asked for my help. She told me about the accident. She said that you sit by her bed and read to her and that she can’t wake. We’re here to see to it that she does wake. Can you trust us to do right by you and Raven?”

“How do I know that I can trust you? And you’re right, what you said sounds crazy. It’s not inspiring much faith that you’re here for the right reasons.”

“If Raven remains like she is for much longer she will die.” I state.

“What are you talking about? The doctors say she’s in a coma.”

“I’m talking about saving her life. Is that something that you are interested in?” I ask bluntly, losing my patience while trying to get through her defenses.

“Yes, by all means. But I don’t know any of you, and I’m not sure what to do. She’s all the family I have left.” Daphne’s voice trembles and she’s now on the verge of tears, her false bravado gone.

Elrond steps forward at that moment and kneels down in front of Daphne and looks her directly in the eye. For a moment nothing is said, and then slowly he takes her hand and says, “Daphne, my name is Elrond. I know that this is an unusual set of circumstances. You don’t know who to trust right now, but I swear to you on my honor as a druid that we mean you and Raven no harm. We are truly here to help and have your best interest at heart.”

They stare at one another for another moment. “What Mr. Tibbs didn’t tell you is he has been her guardian all of her life and is in charge of her awakening. Then he plans to marry her. You know the procedures for women here, right?”

Then with a slight nod of her head, Daphne looks up to me with unshed tears in her eyes and then back to Elrond. “Will you be there for me? Will you explain the process and help me if I get scared? I’m so scared right now I don’t know what to believe but I want Raven back with us. She is all the family I have. I can’t make it without her.”

Elrond puts an arm around her and pulls her close. “I will be here for you every step of the way. I’ll stay right here beside you and won’t move.”

“Okay, I trust you”, she says looking into Elrond’s warm eyes. “I’m not sure why, but I do.” With a quizzical, uncertain glance, she nods again at Elrond as something unspoken passes between them.

“Thank you, Daphne.” I turn to Nemus and ask, “What must we do first?”

“First, the necklace – she will need her talisman in order to get started.”
