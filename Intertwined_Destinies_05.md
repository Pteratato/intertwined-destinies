# #05 [Brody]

Trixie is on my last nerve. If she bounces one more time I’m going to duct tape her to the inside of the windshield. 

“Will you please settle down?” I grate out between clenched teeth. She's overdosed on sugar and now all she does is hop around on the dashboard.

As we pull up outside the hospital, I hop out of the vehicle before it's even parked and make my way into the hospital entrance. As I enter, I stalk toward the information desk. “I need to know what room Morgan Nightshade is in, please?”

“Are you family? It’s after visiting hours and only family may enter to see her after visiting hours,” the receptionist states with a tight-lipped grimace.

Her words push me over the edge and I explode. I know I’m about to say something I'll regret, but my guards gather around me. Finn steps forward and very gently persuades the receptionist to give us her room number and buzz us in.

“Thank you," I say, turning to Finn. "I’m obviously not holding up so well. Your coolheaded actions are appreciated.”

I turn towards my men, giving them instructions. “I want Tiern and Tolin to be outside. Put perimeters around the hospital and stand guard. Trixie and Finn, you’re with me.”

As we navigate the wing Morgan is in, Finn sets about persuading the hospital staff to stay away from her room until further notice. Hopefully it will last long enough for us to get her awakening done.

Trixie, Finn, and I enter the room. Fiona gasps and looks around, rapidly taking in the intrusion and what it might mean. “Who are you? And what are you doing here?”

I hold up my hands in a submissive posture. “Fiona, my name is Brody, and we mean you no harm. We are here to help. We came to bring Morgan back and do her awakening.”

“Oh, yeah, she's been telling me it’s going to be okay because Brody is coming to help. I just thought she was saying it for my benefit, to cheer me up. I’ve heard about a Trixie too. Morgan wants to meet her. Did she come?”

Suddenly the little faerie flutters out of my pocket, startling Fiona. “I’m Trixie!”

“Wow, Morgan didn’t tell me you were a faerie. You're gorgeous!”

“Thank you so much, Fiona, Morgan came to us and asked us to help. Brody here is her guardian, and has been since she was an infant. He is the one who took her to the Mortal Realm. If he can do her awakening, she'll wake up.”

“Wow! I felt her hug me a couple of times and I heard her mumbling in her sleep about you and Brody but I didn’t know she could do all that in a comatose state.”

“Yeah, it’s kind of like she's in a dream-like state. She told us about the accident. She said you sit by her bed and read to her but she is frightened because she can’t wake up. Did someone take her necklace off her?”

Fiona nods. “Yes, they took it off her in the emergency room when they were trying to get her back again. Once we were in our room the nurse told me not to put it back on her so I left it on the bedside table for a few days. One day I felt her hug me and tell me you were coming and somehow the necklace went flying off the table onto the floor. I took it as a sign that she wanted it back on so I put it on her. Grandma always told her she had to wear it until she was at least eighteen but even I didn’t understand the purpose. But she is eighteen now so why does she still have to wear it?” Fiona asks with a trembling voice.

Brody stepped forward at that moment and knelt down in front of her and looks her directly in the eye. “I understand this is an unusual set of circumstances. It’s understandable that you are frightened, too, and don’t know who to trust. But I swear to you on my honor as a prince and Morgan’s guardian and kindred, that we mean you no harm. We are truly here to help and we have both of your best interests at heart. When we are done with her awakening, we will get you two out of this hospital. I promise.”

They stare at one another for another moment. “Fiona, I became Morgan’s guardian when she was an infant. I have watched over her for eighteen mortal years.  And I am also in charge of her awakening.”

“Yeah, about that, just what is an awakening,“ she questions, looking at me with unshed tears in her eyes.

“Since Morgan is not part of the Mortal World we have to change her so she can return to our world now. She was sent to the Mortal Realm for protection. Her necklace changed what she looked like to keep her safe, but now she can come back home where she belongs.”

“Safe? Safe from what?"

“Well, you see,” Brody starts again, “where we come from your aunt is royalty and there are people waiting for her there, because she is the answer to our realm's healing.”

“Oh, right, now you are telling me a faerie tale. I’m not stupid so don’t treat me like I am. There is no way my aunt can heal a realm. Maybe you should just go back and leave us alone,” She says as she stands up, getting angry now.

“Shhh, Fiona,” Trixie says as she flutters up to where Fiona stands. “We’ll have the hospital staff in here if we aren’t careful and we don’t need that. Brody is going to continue explaining this until you understand, okay?” she asks while rubbing Fiona’s back to help calm her. “Brody is telling you the truth, though.”

Fiona finally nods and sits back down on the wheelchair and looks at Brody for him to continue his tale.

“Fiona, Morgan’s mother is a goddess in the realm I come from. Morgan is the key to our realm's problems. She was born for this. Only Morgan can change things there. Her abilities are very powerful, and she was born to help take care of our realm. Once we are done with her awakening you’ll be able to see the change, and know what we're referring to. Once we are done with all this I plan to marry her and take her back to her home realm. You can come with us.”

Fiona shakes her head. “I still think this sounds like a faerie tale.”

“No, it’s not. If you will trust us for just a few minutes, we will do Morgan’s awakening. Then she will remember more, and she can tell you as well.”

“Okay,” she says with a big sigh. “Okay. I am ready for her to come back to me.”

“Now this gorgeous elf here is a druid. His name is Finn. He is going to help your aunt with her awakening. I'll stay right here beside you and talk you through everything as it happens so you will understand. And if you don’t understand something, just ask.”

“Okay, I know Morgan needs some help to come back so I’m willing to go that far at least,” she answers with an uncertain glance.

I put my hand on her shoulder and nod at Finn. “You can get started now.” 

He looks back at Fiona and says “Thank you, Fiona. I’ll be right beside you the whole time.”

Fiona stares back at him, almost smiling. She can’t wait to have her aunt back.
