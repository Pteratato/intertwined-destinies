# #04 [Brody]

“Trixie, I would like you to come with me please. You've met Morgan a couple of times and with all that’s happened I’m sure she could use a female friend. You may ride in my pocket, if you wish.”

“Guards, we are bringing Morgan home today. It’s imperative that we get to her and fast. I’m sure my concern for her predicament and how much I care about her is apparant. If so, that should help you see how quickly we need to get this done.”

I look around the edge of the tree and see a dryad form begin to emerge.

“Jasmine,” I address the dryad, “I need you and your sisters to pass on a message to the Aos Si. Can you do that? Get the word to them that my guard and I will be heading that way before nightfall to pass through the dolmen portal to the Mortal Realm.”

“As always Brody, we are at your service.” Jade says as she curtsies, and merges back with the tree. Before long, the forest will be a buzz with word of our coming.

I let out a loud, practiced whistle calling Blaze, my shire horse. He’s my mount, my partner, and an old friend. Blaze appears over the ridge and gallops toward me, his black mane flying behind him, his body a gleaming, dark mass of muscle. He has a white blaze on his face that covers his crystal blue eyes and each leg from the knee down is covered in long, white silky hair. Blaze stands over 18 hands tall; in a word, he is massive. We have been together through thick and thin and I would trust no other with this mission to get me to my men and to Raven. Blaze comes to a halt before us, but he continues to paw at the ground with his hooves impatiently.

“Trixie, jump up here, please, we need to get going.” Her shrill voice rings in my ears, protesting that she's never ridden on a horse. “I’m not sure what you're worried about since you have wings, but you can ride in my pocket.”

She jumps up on my arm, then slides all the way to the bottom to hide, and we're off.

Blaze is not only huge but he is fast, and we ride like the wind away from the secret meadow, away from the tree of life that borders between the Mortal Realm and the Otherworld Realm. I’m on a mission to get my men, my guard warriors that I have trained with for missions just like this. I can only pray that we are ready for what awaits us.

It takes just under an hour to make our way to *Glendale Loche Keep*, where my men are practicing. I pull up on Blaze and see my men training just inside the walls of the Keep.

“Ready yourselves!” I call out to my men. “We ride out in less than an hour to the Mortal Realm. Dress appropriately. I also need you armed; I’m not sure what we will face in the Mortal Realm. Things are not as they seem there,” I say as I look around. “Where is Finn? He will need to accompany us.”

Trixie takes this minute to vacate my pocket, zipping around in an agitated state. 

“What’s wrong,  Trixie?”

“How am I supposed to travel in the Mortal Realm? I don’t believe there are any sprites, faeries, pixies, or dryads there, according to Morgan,” She moans.

“I will have Finn conjure you a traveling glamour, it will be fine. I have a few things to do quickly before we head out.”

I turn to address my men again who are now packing their training gear. “Liam, I need you in charge of provisions and rations for the journey, please. Tiern and Torin, please round up additional weapons. The two of you can also plot our course; and you’ll also be in charge of Mortal Realm technology. We will be entering the Mortal Realm in the Appalachian Mountains in Tennessee. Aiden and Brian, I need you two to follow us to the sidhe portal and then stay there and be my eyes and ears while we're gone. You can also assist the other men with preparation for our departure. I will meet you all in the Library in thirty minutes. Finn, Trixie, with me, please.”

As we enter the foyer of the castle I quickly run up to my chambers, taking two steps at a time. Trixie and Finn stay in the outer court to get the glamour done.

I go to my wardrobe and grab black, fatigue-style cargo pants, combat boots, and my black leather baldric to holster my sword. I quickly change out of my leathers and pick up some of my gear. I make my way back to the outer chambers where I find Finn and Trixie arguing over her glamour.

“Finn, Morgan needs us. We head out shortly. Trixie will be traveling with us and she'll need a cloaking spell, as will the rest of us that are traveling to the Mortal Realm to hide our weapons. What can you do for Trixie?"

Finn looks from me to Trixie with his stoic features, considering my request. “Well, we already found out she doesn’t want to be a Ferret. She calls them dirty rodents.”

“Nope, I think not.” She says with disgust, shaking her head. “Seriously!”

Finn looks affronted, but reconsiders. “Okay then, how about a myna bird? They're small and can replicate sounds. They're considered talking birds. For the rest of you, I'll cloaked your ears and weapons.”

Trixie is nods her head and she finally says, “I agree. At least I can speak my mind.”

“Okay,” Brody speaks up. “We are all happy now so let’s make our way to the library so I can brief everyone before we head out.”

At the library I share all that I know with my traveling companions. There are a few questions all around, which I quickly answer to the best of my ability with the knowledge that I have. “Mount up, men!”

We mount and make our way to the sidhe mound and the dolmen that will take us to the Mortal Realm. Hopefully in a close vicinity to where Morgan and Fiona are located.

#[Morgan]

*'Limbo,' that’s what Brody said, I’m stuck in limbo. His words are not making me feel better. I might as well be stuck in the Bermuda Triangle.* 

I sigh to myself. I really hope nothing gets in the way of Brody finding us. If he doesn’t, I wonder what will happen to Fiona and I? I’ll be stuck in limbo and they will send Fiona off to go home. This is such a mess. If they can’t find us, Fiona and I may just as well give it up. I have to stop now. I can’t think about all this or I'll lose the little mind that I have left.

The meadow is something I want to think about. It’s so gorgeous there. It gives me hope that things aren’t quite as bad as they may seem. The sun rising and all the faeries fluttering about with the light reflecting off their silken, iridescent wings; wings that remind me of a dragonfly. And the rays of the sun reflecting off the water in that tranquil pool, with the huge slide and the Unicorn, the Dragon, and the Panther guarding the children playing in the water. I love watching the children play. They all seem to get along so well. I wonder, are they siblings, just friends, what? 

The animals that surround them seem so happy as well, and I can almost see them smiling at the children as they play. Man, I really want to know who these children are and what makes them so happy. Where do they live? Where are their parents? There has to be more to this story. I’ll ask Brody when he finds us. I want to go back to that meadow physically. Everything is so gorgeous there it just takes my breath away. I want to come back and talk to these children as well.

Looking to the right I see the nymphs, butterflies, birds, rabbits, and wombats. *Wow.* They all look like they live in peace here. It makes me wonder what else is here. And, where in the world is *here*? No pun intended; I know it’s not the Mortal Realm, but I guess contrary to our teachings other Realms do exist?

This is simply spectacular. It’s magickal in an otherworldly way. Man, when Brody stepped out from that big Willow tree... I could have stopped breathing right then and there. That smile, and the cute elf ears... well, it looks like I have found my tall, dark, and delicious, huh? 

He is all mine, too. I hope, anyway.

Above all, the words he said to me struck something deep in my core. I don’t know how but we are connected. He said that he was my guardian and my kindred soul, and that our destinies were intertwined. I’m not sure what all that means but there is one thing I know for certain; I know in my heart that I know him from somewhere but I don’t remember where. His name is forever branded across my soul. I feel this in the depths of my being. It defies everything that I know about the world I currently live in, but unless I’m utterly loony tunes, he, this meadow, the children, the tree, and I are all connected. I just don’t know *how*.

As much as I’m drawn to Brody, I’m also drawn to that tree, and that group of children in the pool, but in my current predicament I’ll have to wait and see if Brody can find me and free me from this eternal dark prison, my limbo, this void where I currently exist. My strength continues to fade so I’m not sure how much longer I can last, but I will try my best to hold out until there is no more lifeforce left in me, and I’ll put my faith in my kindred.

The sun is beginning to set by the time we approach the sidhe. I know we've made good time, but I also feel we're cutting this way too close. I can feel Morgan’s strength fading faster and I’m worried she won’t last until we get there. I stop and say a little prayer for her, knowing that it's all I can do at this point. I’m asking her mother to help her stay as strong until we can get there.

The sooner we’re able to pass into the Mortal Realm, the better.

The Elders come out to greet us as we ride up to the outskirts of the mound in the dwindling light of day. The Elders are Fae people who live here and serve as guardians to the doleman portals. Their leader, Meria, steps forward. She is an elder elf with long, flowing silver hair and twinkling emerald eyes. Nodding, she addresses me.

“Greetings, Brody,” She says with a smile.

“Meria, it’s a pleasure as always,” I greet her in kind. “My guard and I seek passage to the Mortal Realm, it is imperative that we leave as soon as possible.”

“Agreed, young prince. I have seen her and you need to be quick because as the sun sets you will lose another day if you’re not ready, one that cannot be lost right now since the situation is critical. She needs you to make haste, you and your guard,” Meria states with a determined air.

“Aiden, Brian, will you take care of the horses for me and await our return?” I ask as I dismount Blaze. I give him a quick nuzzle and tell him to keep a lookout for anything out of the ordinary, like I always do, as I walk away. 

“The rest of you, it’s time to gather our gear. We need to make it to the doleman portals before the sun sets, and we’ve only precious moments before then,” I say as we make our way up the green mound toward the four standing doleman. We walk toward the stone portal with the markings for the Mortal Realm. The five of us gather together as we seek passage to Earth. We're eager to be on our way but in order to activate the portal, I must wait until the exact moment the sun is about to set, casting rays of light on the portal. I reach down and grab some loose dirt, tossing it into the doleman entry to activate the portal. As the dirt hits the rays of light, the portal is activated and we have exactly two minutes to enter. I turn toward Meria. 

“Thank you for your warm welcome and your service to the portals of the sidhe. Please await our return from the Mortal Realm, until then you have Aiden and Brian at your service.” I bow briefly and then follow my men, with Trixie once more in my pocket, through the portal to find Morgan.

“Whoa, so this is the Mortal Realm? What’s wrong with the trees?” Trixie asks as she flutters about. “They seem sickly, not as healthy and vibrant as back home, and where are the dryads? I don’t sense any nearby. I’m not sure I like the Mortal Realm, the air smells funny and...." Finally, she’s at a loss for words, fluttering around in circles.

“Trixie, the Mortals that live here have no idea what their modern technology is doing to their world. They’re slowly but surely killing their planet. There are very few dryads left in the world but they can be found in the oldest of trees that remain,” I say, then change the subject. “Now, men, we need to quickly make it to the safe house to get the car. We have to hurry; the doctors don’t think Morgan will make it through the night. But since Meria has seen her, we have all the directions we need. I know you’re tired and so am I, but as soon as we get there we need to head out, and most of you can sleep in the car on the way to the hospital."

It takes us close to an hour to climb to the top of the mountain ridge, where the safe house is located. We take a bathroom break and get provisions, then we hear Finn signal that our departure is imminent.

"Load 'em up!"
