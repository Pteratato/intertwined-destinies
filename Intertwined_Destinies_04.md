# #04 [Mr. Tibbs]

“Trixie, you’re coming with me.” I commanded. “The rest of you know what to do – we’re bringing her home.”

I hope my concern about Raven’s predicament isn’t too apparent on my face as I quickly analyze the best course of action and set things in motion.

”I know how imperative it is that I get to her and fast, but before we get to the sidhe mound that will take us to the Mortal Realm we need to let *Aos Si*, the sidhe guardians, know that we are coming. That’s something I can task the dryads to help with; the tree nymphs can quickly pass on the message.”

I look around the edge of the tree and see a dryad form begin to emerge.

“Jade,” I address the dryad, “I need you and your sisters to pass on a message to the Aos Si. Can you do that? Get the word to them that my guard and I will be heading that way before nightfall to pass through the dolmen portal to the Mortal Realm.”

“As always, Mr. Tibbs, we are at your service and it will be done!” Jade says as she curtsies, and merges back with the tree. Before long, the forest will be a buzz with word of our coming.

“Mr. Tibbs, why am I coming with you? I have never been to the Mortal Realm,” Trixie demands as she flitters about me.

“Because Raven will need a friendly fae face once she awakens. I think you and she have connected, and you will be a gentle reminder that she was not dreaming. Her awakening is going to be much more challenging than any of us thought possible with the recent turn of events,” I say, worry evident in my voice. Then I let out a loud whistle calling Blaze, my shire horse. He’s my mount, my partner, and an old friend.

Blaze appears over the ridge and gallops toward me, his black mane flying behind him, his body a gleaming, dark mass of muscle. He has a white blaze on his face that covers his crystal blue eyes and each leg from the knee down is covered in long, white silky hair. Blaze stands over 18 hands tall; in a word, he is massive. We have been together through thick and thin and I would trust no other with this mission to get me to my men and to Raven. Blaze comes to a halt before us, but he continues to paw at the ground with his hooves impatiently.

“I’ve never ridden a horse before, and you expect my first time to be on this beast? You have got to be kidding me,” she mutters in a shrill voice.

“I’m not sure what you’re so worried about, you have wings – it’s not like you’re going to hit the ground if he bucks, which he won’t.”

“I know it’s an irrational fear, but I can’t help it!” She shouts with her hands on her hips. “Can I ride in your pocket? Please?”

I agree and then mount up with Trixie in the front pocket of my shirt, and we are off. Blaze is not only huge but fast, and we ride like the wind away from the secret meadow, away from the Tree of Life that borders between the Mortal Realm and the Otherworld Realm. I have to get to my men, my guard – warriors that I have trained with for missions just like this. I can only pray to the god and goddess that we are ready for what awaits us.

It has taken us just under an hour to make our approach to Glendale Loch Keep. I pull up on Blaze; my men are training just inside the walls of the Keep.

“Ready yourselves!” I call out to my men. “We ride out in less than an hour for the Mortal Realm. Dress appropriately and arm yourself – I’m not sure what we will face in the Mortal Realm, things are not as they seem. Where is the Druid? He will need to accompany us.”

Trixie takes this moment to vacate my pocket and start zipping around in an agitated state.

“What’s wrong, Trixie?” I ask.

“How the heck am I supposed to travel in the Mortal Realm? There are no sprites, pixies, or faeries there; Raven said so!” She huffs. “Maybe I should just wait here until you get back. It’s not like we’re going to visit Ireland where the old folk know of us.”

“I’ll have Nemus conjure you a traveling glamour and all will be fine. Now I have things to do before we head out.”

I turn to address the men again as they’re putting away their training weapons. “Elmond, I need you in charge of provisions and rations for the journey. Tiern and Torin, I need you both to round up additional weapons. The two of you plot our course; you’ll be in charge of Mortal Realm technology. We will be entering the Mortal Realm in the Appalachian Mountains in Tennessee. Fergi and Fogi, I need you to stay behind to be my eyes and ears and assist with preparations for our departure. Everyone meet in the Library in thirty minutes. Fergi, send Nemus to my chambers, Trixie, you’re with me.” I command.

“Alright, Mr. Bossy Pants, let’s get something straight right here, right now. The only reason I’m here is for Raven. I do not take orders from you so you can stop bossing me around right this minute.” Trixie flutters agitatedly in front of my face again.

“I do apologize for my gruff tone but we’re in a hurry,” I say apologetically. “Please follow me to my chambers where Nemus will join us to cloak you in a glamour for our journey. Time is of the essence.”

“Well, alright, when you put it like that…”

We enter the foyer of the castle and I quickly run up to my chambers, taking the stairs two at a time until I reach the top level. “Trixie, can you remain in my outer chambers until Nemus arrives? I need to change and make ready for our journey. I’ll be just a few minutes.”

I turn and walk into my bedroom suite and make my way to a separate wardrobe. I pull it open and grab a pair of black fatigue style cargo pants, black combat boots, and my black leather baldric to holster my sword. I quickly change out of my leathers and pack some of my gear. Then I make my way back to my outer chambers where I find Nemus and Trixie waiting for me.

“Nemus, Raven needs us. We head out shortly. Trixie will be traveling with us, and she will need a cloaking spell, as will the rest of us traveling to the Mortal Realm to hide our weapons. What can you do for Trixie?” I ask.

Nemus looks at me then Trixie with his stoic feathers and considers my request. “I can glamour her to appear as a ferret? They are small and often travel with their humans.”

“A ferret! You want to glamour me to look like a rodent! You cannot be serious! Absolutely not! I don’t care if it is only a glamour; I will not agree to be a ferret. Seriously!” Trixie protests, looking upset.

Nemus looks affronted but reconsiders. “Okay then, I can glamour her to look like a myna bird. They are small in size and can replicate sounds, and are considered talking birds. The rest of you I will cloak your weapons and your ears.”

“Trixie, are you okay with this?” I ask.

“I agree. Make it so. At least I can speak my mind,” she says.

“Let’s make our way down to the library so I can brief everyone before we leave.”

Once we get to the library, I share all that I know with my men, including Nemus and Trixie. There are a few questions all around which are quickly dealt with and then we mount up and make our way to the sidhe mound and the dolmen that will take us to the Mortal Realm, hopefully in a close vicinity to Raven.

*‘Limbo.’ That’s what Mr. Tibbs said. I’m stuck in ‘limbo,’ His words are so not making me feel better. I might as well be stuck in Siberia.*

“Oh, my goodness!” I suddenly speak aloud. “What if he can’t find me? What’s going to happen? What about poor Daphne? I can’t think about that right now or I’m going to lose my mind.”

The meadow, on the other hand, I can think about. It gives me hope that things are not as bad as they seem. It was so beautiful, the sun rising and all the faeries fluttering about with the light reflecting off their silken, iridescent wings – wings that kind of remind me of dragonflies. Add the rays of the sun, reflecting off the water in that oh-so-tranquil pool with the huge slide and the unicorn guarding the kids playing there. I can almost see the big, red dragon on the other side of the fence surrounding the pool. I don’t know how but I know these animals are happy. I can feel their love for the children playing there. They have the best jobs anyone could ever ask for.

What makes them so happy? There has to be more to this story and I will find out… if Mr. Tibbs can find me. Wow. I want to go back to this meadow but not just in a dream.

Then I see the nymphs, butterflies, birds, rabbits, wombats, and I don’t know what else, all looking in on that sacred meadow. It was simply spectacular, and magical in an otherworldly way. Then when Mr. Tibbs stepped out from under the willow tree, I could have stopped breathing right then and there. That smile, oh my, and those ears! But above all, it was his words that struck something deep in my core. He said that he was my guardian, my kindred soul, and that our destinies were intertwined. I’m not sure what all that means but there is one thing I know for certain; I know in my heart that I know him. His name is forever branded across my soul, and I feel it in the depths of my being. It defies everything I know about the world I currently live in but unless I’m utterly loony tunes, he, this meadow, the tree, and I are all connected. I just don’t know how.

As much as I’m drawn to Mr. Tibbs, I’m also drawn to the tree, and that pool of children, but in my current predicament, I’ll have to wait and see if Mr. Tibbs can find me and free me from this eternally dark prison, my limbo, this void where I currently exist. My strength continues to fade; l’m not sure how much longer I can last, but I will hold out until there is no more life force left in me, and I’ll put my faith in my kindred.

[Mr. Tibbs]

The sun is beginning to set by the time we approach the sidhe. I know that we’ve made good time, but I also feel as if we’re cutting it close. The sooner we’re able to pass into the Mortal Realm the better. My sense of urgency is skyrocketing. The Aos Si come out to greet us as we ride up to the outskirts of the mound in the dwindling light of day.

The Aos Si are a variety of fae people who live on the mound and serve as guardians to the dolmen portals. The leader of the clan, Meria – an elder elf with flowing silver hair and twinkling emerald eyes – steps forward and addresses me. “Greetings, Mr. Tibbs!”

“Meria, it’s a pleasure as always.” I greet her in kind. “My guard and I seek passage to the Mortal Realm, it is imperative that we leave as soon as possible.”

“Agreed, young prince; quick, before the sun sets or you will lose another day, one that cannot be lost. She needs you so make haste, you and your guard,” Meria states with a determined air about her.

“Fergus, Elmond, and Lorcan, take care of the horses and await our return.” I say as I dismount Blaze. I give him a quick nuzzle before I walk away. “Remember, I need you to keep a lookout for anything out of the ordinary. The rest of you gather your gear, we need to make it to the dolmen portals before the sun sets. We’ve only moments before that happens.”

We make our way up the green mound toward the four standing dolmen and walk toward the stone portal with the markings for the Mortal Realm. The six of us gather together as we seek passage to Earth. We are eager to be on our way, but in order to activate the portal I must wait until the exact moment the sun is about to set, casting the last rays of light on the portal. I reach down and gather some loose earth and toss it into the dolman entryway to activate the portal. As the dirt hits the rays of light in the entryway the portal is activated and we have exactly two minutes to enter.

I turn toward Meria, “Thank you for your warm welcome, and your service to the portals of the sidhe. Please await our return from the Mortal Realm, until then you have Fergus, Elmond, and Lorcan at your service.” I bow briefly and then follow my men through the portal to find Raven.

We emerge under an outcropping of rocks that looks like a small cave, facing a forested area with trees and plant life. As we walk out into the light of day, I turn around to look for the marking of the Otherworld. It would be in the rock face of the cave we had just emerged from, and I find it crudely carved into the stone above the entryway. If you weren’t looking for it, one would never know it was there. I pull out my compass and see that the cave faces the eastern sky and note to myself that to enter here we would have to arrive at sunrise. That’s when I notice Trixie zipping about, taking in our surroundings. She lets out a low whistle.

“Whoa, so this is the Mortal Realm? What’s wrong with the trees?” she asks as she flutters about. “They seem sickly, not as healthy or vibrant as back home. Where are the dryads? I don’t sense any nearby. I’m not sure I like the Mortal Realm, the air smells funny and…” And she’s at a loss for words as she flutters around in circles, so I help her out.

“Trixie, the mortals that live here have no idea what their modern technology is doing to their world. They’re slowly killing their planet. There are very few dryads left in this world, but they can be found in the oldest of trees that remain.” I say, then turn to address the guards. “Now, men, let’s quickly make our way to our safe house and see what we can find out about the accident, and where Raven and her niece Daphne are located. As soon as we find where they are, we will head out with whatever provisions we need. Let’s move out!”

It takes us close to an hour to make our way from the mountain ridge to the safe house, but once we are there, Dylan sets about gathering information using a computer we have stashed there. It doesn’t take him long to find where the girls are hospitalized, and then we set off again to get to Raven and her niece.
