# #13 [Mr. Tibbs]

Raven is very quiet as she sits up, pulling out of my arms. I can tell she’s upset by the turn of events. I pull her back down to me and gently kiss her lips as I look into her eyes. She looks tired with light smudges under her eyes, and it’s obvious to me that she needs rest. 

Rest that she should have gotten last night, and that’s not coming now with the events that will take place today. I catch myself swearing under my breath. I don’t know why that woman couldn’t have left well enough alone. 

“If she had only waited a few short hours, you could have gotten the sleep you needed to get through today,” I say as I hold her close. “I’m sorry. I should have told you. I worried about how you’d react to that kind of news on top of everything else you’re dealing with. Now all of that is swirling around in your head along with everything else you have to do today. I promise once we get to Faerie I’ll contact my uncle, the Dagda. I think we need someone’s assistance.” 

I take a deep, frustrated breath and kiss the top of her head. “Say something, Beautiful. You’re so quiet.”

She sighs heavily and whispers “I love you” in my ear. “Thank you so much for defending me. I just can’t believe that *that* cold, heartless, unfeeling pain-in-the-butt is my mother. Thank the gods that my mortal mother was never like that. I miss her so much,” she says and I can feel her warm tears hit my chest. 

Before I can react, she pulls herself from my arms and sits on the bed, swinging her legs over the side. 

“I told myself no tears today. Today I want to celebrate my time with my family and my earthly mother and that’s what I’m going to do. I just wish I didn’t feel so exhausted. I feel like I didn’t get any sleep at all.” 

“Maybe an energy drink will help if you drink it with breakfast,” I say with a smile, serious but trying to lighten the mood as well.

*Crap* – it's five-forty-five and dawn is on the horizon. It’s time to get up and get ready for the day. 

“Hey,” I say, patting her on the knee. “How about I get up and get showered first so you can rest for another thirty minutes. That’ll still give you plenty of time before everyone else arrives. I’ll even go down and get breakfast so you can eat while getting ready, if you want.”

Raven gives me a smile and says, “Sounds like a plan.” She closes her eyes and I can tell she is out again. 

“Thanks again, Danu,” I mutter as I gather my things and go to the bathroom to shower. 

After showering, I pull on a dark gray suit and matching tie, paired with a pale pink button-up t-shirt. I make my way out of the bathroom and I hear her soft breath escape her lips in little puffs that are utterly adorable. I look at the clock and decide to give her an hour instead of thirty minutes. We don’t have to leave for the services until close to eight-thirty; that should still give us time to eat and talk. So I quietly make my way out of the bedroom and shut the door behind me.

I’m greeted by Nemus and Torin both heading our way, dressed up in shirts and ties. We make our way downstairs to the kitchen. It’s shortly after six in the morning and we’re greeted by Velma and Harley, both dressed for the services today as well.

I quietly let everyone know what had transpired last night. Velma calls over to Daphne’s and lets them know we’re delaying until seven-thirty. Velma putters around the kitchen, putting on coffee and tea. She’s already started preparing several different types of quiche and homemade blueberry muffins. Before I know it, it’s close to six-forty-five so I make my way up to wake Raven.

I find that she’s still sleeping, so I softly sit down by her side and tuck her caramel and golden highlighted hair behind her elven-tipped ears. “It’s time to get up, Sleeping Beauty.” She opens those beautiful whiskey-colored eyes and smiles. 

“It’s six-forty-five. I pushed back our meeting time so you could get another hour of sleep. I brought our breakfast up with me so we can talk and eat while you get ready,” I say as she stretches and sits up.

“You shouldn’t have, but thank you. I do feel a little better now. Give me just a few minutes to shower and I’ll come out and talk and eat.” Raven looks at me and winks. “Thank you so much, my Elf Man.” 

Then, poof, she disappears into the bathroom. She didn’t even look around for her clothes before she went in. I snicker to myself because I had already placed them in the bathroom for her since she had them all laid out last night.
