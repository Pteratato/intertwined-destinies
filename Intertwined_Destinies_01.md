# #01 [Raven] 
 
Summer vacation! Need I say anything more?

My family and I have just spent four fabulous weeks at the beach basking in the sun. I’ve been blessed with an awesome family, and they’re not even blood relatives – I was adopted at the tender age of just one-month-old, or so they think. My sister, Kat, was a young adult when I showed up out of nowhere. Mom found me left outside the entrance to the emergency department at the hospital. Crazy, right? She works there as an RN on the oncology floor and took me in around the same time her daughter Kat was getting married to Jeffry. Strangely enough, I had been abandoned with nothing more than just the basket I was found in, a blanket, a note, and the necklace that I’ve always worn.

Thinking back on my life, I wouldn’t have wanted it any other way. I love my family; they’re amazing and not once have I ever felt anything but 100% loved and a part of this unit. Spending time with family this month has been bittersweet, because in less than three weeks I’m heading off to college, a life altering event to be sure.

The beach house we rented was fantastic. Every morning we woke up to the breathtaking views of the Myrtle Beach shores, and every day we spent the majority of our time on its beautiful white sand. Considering that we live in Indiana – nowhere near the ocean – the view was a tropical paradise. There’s nothing like the sound of waves coming ashore to bring you inner calm and tranquility. It was everything we had hoped it would be, but all good things must come to an end.

It’s crazy how fast four weeks can pass by in the blink of an eye. Four wonderful weeks of no worry about school or anything else.

Well...

There *are* these dreams I’ve been having since my eighteenth birthday, several weeks ago. They feel so real. I’ve never dreamt with such attention to detail, and I can’t help but wonder what they mean. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t mind having these dreams so long as tall, dark, and delicious continues as my leading man. It’s really quite bizarre. I’m not sure exactly what to think of these nightly interludes with my dream man, and I’m definitely not sure about sharing them with anyone else just yet. Not even my best friend.

In these nightly escapades I’m taken to a beautiful meadow, and in the distance I see him under a large weeping willow as if he’s waiting just for me. The strange thing is how it starts, with me leaving my body and traveling to this same scene that has become so familiar and comforting. Then there’s the feeling that I know this man somehow, even though I’ve never seen him before. I’m drawn to him. It should worry me how I react to him but it doesn’t, and I want more than anything for him to be real. I just wish that I could remember more after I wake. Like, did he talk? If so, what did we talk about? What’s his name? The one constant is his handsome face.

Thank God all of this started on vacation. If I had been in college, I would’ve been driven to distraction.

The drive home has been quiet and I’ve had plenty of time to reflect on things. Our journey has been long but uneventful and we’re just a couple hours from home, if that. It’s twilight as we come upon the Smoky Mountains in Tennessee, and the humidity is unusually heavy. As night begins to build, it settles on the mountains like a thick white shroud, and our visibility is impacted. I volunteer to drive so mom can rest and be ready for her first shift back at the hospital.

Looking around the interior of the vehicle, I notice mom is dozing in the back seat with my niece Daphne, and my best friend is listening to her iPod and texting. We’re two car lengths ahead of Kat and the rest of our crew as we make our way towards Indiana.

We begin our descent off the mountain, and I notice a semi-truck emerging like a ghost out of the dense fog behind us. It’s closing in at an incredible rate, and I try to find an opening to move out of its path, but weekend traffic is absurdly heavy. A sense of dread overcomes me, and I look over to Eldurwen and shout, “Hold On!”

The fog is distorting distances and images, but I look in the rearview mirror again and I see the semi is out of control and about to overtake my sister’s SUV. Mom jolts up, looking around.

“Raven, what’s wrong?” She asks in alarm.

Everything takes place in slow motion.

I vaguely hear the truck behind me lay on their horn repeatedly, sounding an alarm which is already too late to heed. I hear the truck as it slams into Kat’s SUV, and the sound is indescribable. I’m still trying in vain to find a way out of the path of destruction while praying that my sister and her family will be okay. Mom in the back seat, frantic. Daphne has just now noticed the chaos and the feeling of impending doom settles over us.

Some invisible force hits the ‘play’ button of Time, and the truck behind us rams Kat’s SUV off the road. The attached trailer begins to jack-knife at eighty miles an hour, and before I know it, Kat’s SUV is totally out of control and rolling end-over-end, slamming into the median. The trailer is airborne and heading for us; there’s nowhere to go.

My last thought before the trailer hurling towards us collides with our vehicle?

*Oh snap.*

---

I become aware of sounds all around me, but I’m unable to move. I hear people around me talking and relaying vital signs, rushing around, bringing other people up to speed of the accident situation. I’m oddly numb as I hear voices relay information to one another.

*"There were only two survivors, both female."*

My heart is breaking.

From what sounds like a million miles away, I can hear the doctors and nurses frantically trying to save my life. The machine I’m hooked up to signals a flatline response as my heart stops.

I’m looking down upon myself, detached and numb.

I take in the scene below me. I’m covered in blood, and my face and skin are ashen even beneath the dark tan that I had gotten while on the beach. Vaguely, I survey the scene and see that Daphne is in the next room. The medical staff is busy working on her.

*Thank God Daphne survived.*

Poor Daphne is going to be all alone.

Then I feel a jolt. I’m pulled back to my body as an electrical pulse races through my chest, jump-starting my heart; I gasp for air as everything fades to black.

---

Where am I? It’s as if I’m awake but it’s totally dark, and I’m all alone. How long have I been in this dark cocoon? Do I care? Not really. In one total car crash my entire world has changed. Wrapped up in this dark place is not so bad. I don’t have to think,

To feel...

To move...

Nothing!..

I’m having a moment of lucidity. In these moments, the pain of losing my family is still so very fresh, so raw. I know there’s nothing I can do to bring them back. With that acceptance one would think that the darkness would have dissipated… but it doesn’t.

What the heck? Where am I, and how do I get back? Darkness is everywhere; it surrounds me, cocooning me from everything, even my senses. I feel nothing but the ache in my heart for the loss of my family.

Now the darkness is pressing in on me, beginning to feel like a cage, a prison. I need to escape, but how? I’m trapped. One thing I know for sure, It’s time to wake up, or figure out what the heck is going on with me. If Daphne survives, she’s going to need me.

*Come on, Raven, think!*

*You need help, so get your butt in gear and figure a way out of this seriously bad situation. Come on now; focus.*

But I can’t wake; it’s not like I haven’t tried.

My mind keeps going back to the weird dreams I’ve been having. I decide to try and replicate my dreams. They’ve been so realistic, and at this point, what could it hurt?

I think about how my dreams begin with me rising out of my body, somehow tethered by a shimmery, silvery cord. I concentrate on this visual and, surprisingly without much effort, I feel myself rise up, tied to my physical person as if I’ve done this a million times before – and maybe I have. For the first time in days or more, there’s no darkness surrounding me.

I look down on myself, and I see Daphne in a wheelchair crying softly, begging me to come back to her. My heart breaks just a little more, but I know this is bigger than just me being injured. I glance at the bedside table and see the necklace that I should be wearing, and reach up as if to touch it around my ethereal neck.

I need to find tall, dark, and delicious; the guy from my dreams. What’s his name? I’m sure I should know it.

My only thought is to get to him and, in an instant, I’m on my way.
