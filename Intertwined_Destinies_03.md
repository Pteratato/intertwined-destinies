# #03 Morgan

Fiona is still at my side but now she has a book in hand. I feel so bad for her, losing all her family in one day and having no one here to talk to. I put my arms around her while weeping. “I love you, Fiona. I know you are my niece but you have always been my best friend as well. Just hang on a bit longer. Help is on the way. I promise.” 

My arm accidently brushes the table by the bedside and knocks my necklace to the floor. Fiona jumps up and grabs my necklace and takes a good look at it. “Whew, good, it’s not broken.” 

Then she looks at me, my body deathly still against the stark white sheets of the hospital bed. I get a good look at her now and she's pretty banged up with a huge bandage around her head and one of her legs set in a cast. There is only a year’s difference in our age; she has always been my best friend. Suddenly, feeling drained, I’m pulled back into my body. 

“Here, let’s go ahead and put this back on you before it gets lost or broken. The nurse told me not to put it back on you but I am anyway. I know you’re supposed to always have it on.” After she closes the clasp she puts her arms around me. “I’m pretty sure I heard you talking to me. If you can hear me please come back to me. Please! I need you Morgan. Please, please don’t leave me, don’t leave me too,” she says as the tears are streaming down her face. 

I feel my arms going up around her as well and I know there are tears streaming down my face as well. I tell her again, “Help is on the way. I’ve spoken to Brody about coming to do my awakening and they are coming here to help us. Just hold on a bit longer Fiona and don’t give up. All this will soon be over my friend.”

She walks back to her bed wiping tears out of her eyes and grabs her book. “I have to tell you about this book I’ve been reading. It’s so good,” and she begins to ramble.
 
After Fiona was fast asleep in her bed I began to think about some of the things that Trix said to me. The trip was both scary and awesome! But I know I’ve developed a new ability but am not sure why it would be happening to me. And then there is this conversation with the faerie… seriously, where did this all come from? My awakening and I need my guardian? Is any of this true or am I just making it up?

Try as I might, I can’t for the life of me figure out why those words just burst from my lips. They just bubbled out of me from somewhere locked deep inside. So far I’ve been unable to repeat my previous journey to the meadow. I think I’m drained. I feel that I have no energy. Now I’m stuck again in my dark prison to ponder whether I’ve been taking the crazy train straight to loony town or not. All those talks of realms and faeries and astral projection, we have never believed in all that. My mother raised us in church and all that was Satan’s battlefield. I can’t do those kinds of things.

I can’t help but still believe something beyond my comprehension is happening to me no matter how ridiculous it all sounds. Ever since my eighteenth birthday I’ve felt off, and now this. Mom told me to always wear my necklace, and then when I turned eighteen I would be able to read the letter left to me from my birth mother who had abandoned me when I was just weeks old. But since we were on vacation for my birthday mom said she would give it to me once we got back. She had kept it all this time.
Now, I feel an urgent need to read that letter. I swore that her words would mean nothing to me, but now I’m not so sure. I worry there’s something in that letter that I should have read before now, before all this happened. I know that my strength is beginning to fade, I can feel it, but at the same time I feel an overwhelming need to try and reach the meadow just one more time before I fade away to nothing. They might not be able to find the right hospital. I don’t know if Trix understood all that or not. I reach deeper inside myself to muster up the energy to do what must be done before it’s too late.

“God, if you are listening, please help me do this. I know I was always taught it was the devil's playground and if that’s true I’m so sorry. Please forgive me but if I can’t accomplish this I think Fiona and I both will die.”

Just like before, I imagine replicating what I had done on my last journey to the meadow, but this time I think about tapping into my core energy, the same energy that I can feel fading.

As I gather up my strength I think about what I need to do and once again I’m on my way. This time, there’s no stopping to see my hospital surroundings. My ethereal body, along with its tether, is speeding past everything on my way back to the meadow.

Soon, I’m standing in the magical meadow; and for the first time since the accident I spin around to take in all my surroundings. What I remember most from my previous dream walks is the images I saw of Brody may not have been detailed, and the events that happened were blurred and unfocused. Now, I’m amazed at how vibrant the colors are; colors like I have never seen before, kind of like Technicolor of old films.
I notice that the meadow is surrounded by a forest in the distance. There is a waterfall that feeds a gentle pond. I believe I had seen it on my last visit, but the most important feature I had failed to notice was the tree. Yes, I remember Brody being under the tree but without him being under the tree my focus is now centered on the tree alone.

It’s magnificent; a beautiful, enormous, weeping willow. I find myself drawn to it, even though it’s in the middle of the pool of water, rooted on a small green island. I find myself moving towards it, drawn by a mystical force that I can’t deny. The sun is rising and the sky is layered with a multitude of colors; and the air is shimmering and twinkling with faeries as the sun reflects off their skin and wings. It is quite literally the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. I hear it calling me to come back. I hear the wind calling me to come back home. This is where you belong!
“Trix; are you here?” I manage to ask in a quiet, reverent voice.

“Yes, my lady.” I hear her quiet voice to my right. “What are you doing back again? Brody is gathering the guard to come to you. You look very washed out my lady. You shouldn’t be back again. We really need to get to you fast.”

“Will you come too, Trix? I feel like I know you and I’d like for you to come too?”
I look around while she is talking and find not only faeries but other mythical creatures that are all staring at me like I was someone important; how odd.

I continue on my path to the tree. It’s truly magnificent. I have never seen anything like it but I sense that everything is not as it seems here. As I get closer I sense the tree is failing. The changes are minute but they are there and it alarms me.

“I was afraid if I didn’t come back you might not find the right hospital. I’m sure there are many hospitals here in the Smokey’s. See, we were on a beach vacation for my birthday, and on the way back there was a terrible accident. I saw myself die, but now I’m disconnected from my body, trapped in a void. I can travel here, but I can’t wake up. I’ve tried. I fear if I don’t get Brody’s help I’m sure that I will cease to be; Fiona too. We have lost all of our other family members and she won’t be able to handle losing me too!”

“You’re unable to wake?” I heard it coming from the direction of the willow tree. “That can only mean one thing. Your talisman has been removed. You are supposed to wear it until your awakening, now you’re stuck in limbo. By the Goddess, I need to get to you. I need to know exactly where you are. My guards are packing, getting ready to leave.”

“I can’t give you exact details. I know that we were traveling along the 1-75 corridors northbound on our way back. We were just descending out of the Tennessee Mountains and going into Kentucky on our way to Indiana. So, we are somewhere around the Kentucky – Tennessee border. My niece was the only other survivor and she stays with me. I need to get back to her. She is all alone. Brody, can you find me?” I ask as my tether pulls taut signaling that my time is up again.

My attention again gets pulled to the tree. She is stunning but I can feel her life -force ever so slowly ebb out of her and I know that she is not well. I don’t ask myself why or how I know this, I just know. I reach my ethereal hands towards her trunk, lean in, and whisper, “Don’t worry; I’ll make it back, and once I do we’ll fix whatever is afflicting you.”

Then I turn towards Brody again. “Please find me. Do you think you can?”

“There is a portal to the Mortal Realm near where you describe. I and my guard will find you. I promise you, Morgan, do you hear my vow? I have waited eighteen mortal years for you and I’m not about to lose you now.”

My tether pulls taut once again and I feel myself being pulled backwards. I want to stay but now I can’t. I look at Brody with desperation in my eyes as I plead. “Find me Brody, please?”

His eyes met mine as he smiled. “Always, I will always find you. I am your guardian. I’m the other half of your soul. Our destinies are intertwined. I need you to trust me.”
