# #03 [Raven]

Wow, that experience was both cool and scary at the same time.

I’ve either lost my mind, or I’ve developed a really cool ability. I’m not sure what’s happening to me, and then there was that conversation with that faerie… seriously, where did that come from? My “awakening”, and I need my “guardian”?

Try as I might, I can’t for the life of me figure out why those words burst from my lips. It just bubbled up out of me from somewhere locked deep inside. So far, I have been unable to repeat my previous journey to the meadow. It’s as if I’m drained of energy. Now I’m stuck in my dark prison to ponder whether I’ve taken the crazy train straight to loony town. All that talk of realms and faeries and astral projection. Right?

I believe something beyond my comprehension is happening to me, no matter how ridiculous that sounds. Ever since my eighteenth birthday I’ve felt off, and now this? Mom told me to always wear my necklace and that when I turned eighteen, I would be able to read the letter left to me by my birth mother – the very same mother who had abandoned me when I was just weeks old. But since we were on vacation for my birthday, mom said she would give me the letter once we got back. She had kept it all this time…

Now I feel an urgent need to read that letter. I swore that her words would mean nothing to me, but now I’m not so sure. I worry there’s something in that letter that I should have read before now, before all this happened. I know that my strength is beginning to fade. I can feel it, but at the same time, I feel an overwhelming need to try and reach the meadow just one more time before I fade away to nothing. I need to get to Mr. Tibbs before it’s too late. I pray that Trixie has been able to get a message to him. I reach deep inside myself to muster up the energy to do what I must before it’s too late.

Just like before, I imagine replicating what I had done on my last journey to the meadow, but this time, I think about tapping into my core energy, the same energy that I can feel fading. As I gather my strength I think about what I need to do, and once again I’m on my way. This time, there’s no stopping to see my hospital surroundings. My ethereal body, along with its tether, is speeding past everything on my way back to the meadow.

Soon I’m standing in the magical meadow and, for the first time since the accident, I spin around to take in all of my surroundings. What I remember most from my previous dreamwalks was Mr. Tibbs – images that I saw may have been detailed, but happenings were blurred and unfocused. Now I’m amazed at how vibrant the colors are, colors like I have never seen before, kind of like Technicolor from old films.

I notice that the meadow is surrounded by a forest. In the distance there’s a waterfall that feeds a gentle pool. I believe I had seen it on my last visit, but the most important feature I had failed to notice before was the tree. Yes, I remember Mr. Tibbs being under the tree, but without him there my focus is centered on the tree alone.

It’s magnificent; a beautiful, enormous weeping willow. I find myself drawn to it, even though it’s in the middle of the pool of water, rooted on a small green island. I find myself moving towards it, drawn in by a mystical force that I can’t deny. The sun is rising and the sky is layered with a multitude of colors, and the air is shimmering… with what? Oh my, the air is shimmering and twinkling with fairies as the sun reflects off of their skin and wings, and it’s quite literally the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.

“Trixie, are you here?” I manage to ask in a quiet, reverent voice.

“Yes, my lady,” I hear quietly to my right.

“My name is Raven, and I’m no one’s lady. Have you been able to get a message to Mr. Tibbs?” I ask as I continue to walk towards the magnificent tree. She calls to something deep inside of me.

“Yes, my lady,” Trixie responds.

“Can you please just call me ‘Raven’, you’re making me so uncomfortable. Where is Mr. Tibbs?”

“He camps beneath the tree. You’ll find him there.” She says as she looks me over. “You look washed out, not like you did the other day. You must get to Mr. Tibbs as soon as possible.”

I look around and find that not only faeries, but other mythical creatures are all staring at me as if I were someone special, someone important. How odd. I continue on my path to the tree. It’s truly magnificent; I have never seen anything like it, but everything is not all as it seems. As I grow closer, I sense that the tree is failing. The changes are minute but they are there and it alarms me.

“Mr. Tibbs, are you there? I need to speak to you.“ I call out.

A man emerges from beneath the tree’s canopy and wow! I’m struck speechless; he is quite possibly the most breathtaking male I have ever seen. A gentle breeze moves through the billowing branches of the willow, the limbs swaying around him in a weaving motion that caresses his upper body in a manner I’m suddenly jealous of – if only I were those branches, lightly dancing across his broad shoulders, I think wistfully. This is Mr. Tibbs, and I know him. He is mine.

“Raven, what are you doing here? It’s not time yet; you shouldn’t experience your awakening for another few months yet. How is it that you even know about your awakening?” He looks at me quizzically.

I stop midway to the tree. I look down to see stepping stones that begin to appear as I take measured steps toward Mr. Tibbs. “I really don’t have the faintest idea what’s happening to me,” I say in a strangled breath. “I…I’m lost. Can you help me?”

Tears stream down my face and I am abashed at how unbearable I sound. I hang my head in shame. “Everything has changed so suddenly. I think I died in the accident, but somehow they were able to bring me back to life. Now I can’t wake up! I’m stuck and I know I’m fading. I don’t know how else to explain it. Please?” I beg breathlessly. “Can you help me?”

“What accident, Raven? What are you talking about?” His concern is evident in his voice.

I look up through my lashes to peer upon his handsome face. His eyes are a brilliant, piercing blue. His jawline is strong and chiseled to perfection, with the slightest hint of a five o’clock shadow. His skin is highly tanned and his wavy, chestnut-colored hair is unruly in the gentle breeze. He definitely knows a thing or two about working out; his biceps are impressive and his pecs strain against the sleeveless leather vest he wears. Ever so slowly, his mouth begins a quirk into a smile as he looks at me and a dimple emerges.

Then I notice his ears, and oh, good gravy, his ears are pointed, and I gasp as I realize that the man of my dreams is not human at all, but an elf. I should’ve known all along, but at that moment I don’t care if he is an elf. He is simply the most alluring man I have ever seen, and my eyes meet his.

Well, snap! I think to myself. I just got caught checking him out.

I blushed furiously and stutter, “Wh…what?”

“Raven?” his smirk grows larger.

I get a grip on myself. “I think I need your help. I’m in a hospital somewhere near the Smokies in Tennessee. We were coming back from a beach vacation and there was a terrible accident. I saw myself die, but now I’m disconnected from my body, trapped in a void. I can travel here, but I can’t wake up, I’ve tried! I fear without your help, I will cease to be. I have vague memories or dreams of you, but they’re disjointed and I don’t know who you are to me.”

“I know that I know you, but I don’t know how,” I continue to ramble on. “I know in my heart I trust you, and I know that only you can help me. Please, I beg you, Mr. Tibbs!” My cries echo softly around the meadow.

I look up and see Trixie hovering near my face, and she reaches up to wipe my tears. I lean in towards her for a moment, and allow her to comfort me. Then I turn my gaze towards Mr. Tibbs, who is deep in thought. “Mr. Tibbs?”

Those brilliant blue eyes connect with mine. “You’re unable to wake? That can only mean one thing – your talisman has been removed. You were supposed to wear it until your awakening. Your premature death has started your awakening and without your talisman, you’re stuck in Limbo. By the Goddess, I need to get to you. I need to know exactly where you are!”

“I can’t give you exact details. I know that we were traveling along the I-75 corridor northbound on our way back. We were just leaving the Tennessee Mountains and going into Kentucky, to Indiana, somewhere around the Kentucky-Tennessee border. My niece Daphne was the only other survivor and she stays with me – I need to get back to her, she’s all alone. Mr. Tibbs, can you find me?” I ask as my tether pulls taut, signaling that my time is up.

I look around at the otherworldly scenery, and I’m humbled to be surrounded by such beauty and majesty. I gaze at Mr. Tibbs and reach my hand up to touch his face, but I hesitate because I want so much more than a ghostly touch. My attention is pulled to the tree once more. She is stunning but I can feel her life-force ever so slowly ebb out of her, and I know that she is not well. I don’t ask myself why or how I know this, I just know.

I reach my ethereal hand towards her trunk, lean in, and whisper, ”Don’t worry; I’ll make it back, and once I do we’ll fix whatever is afflicting you.”

Then I turn towards Mr. Tibbs and plead, ”Please find me. Do you think you can?”

“There is a portal to the Mortal Realm near where you describe. I need to gather my men, and we’ll find you. I promise, Raven. Do you hear my vow? I have waited eighteen mortal years for you!”

My tether pulls taut, and I feel myself being pulled backwards. I want to stay but I know I can’t. I look towards Mr. Tibbs with desperation in my eyes as I plead, ”find me, please.”

His eyes meet mine as he smiles. “Always. I will always find you. I am your guardian. I’m the other part to your soul. Our destinies are intertwined. I need you to trust me.”

“How will you find me?”

“Raven, I have watched over you from afar for some time. I know you’re scared, but I need you to trust that I will find you – that’s my solemn vow.” He responds.

I don’t know why, but I do. I look into his eyes and I’m suddenly pulled away from the meadow and Trixie and Mr. Tibbs. My tether pulls me back to what he calls the Mortal Realm, back to my physical body, back to my prison for the time being.
