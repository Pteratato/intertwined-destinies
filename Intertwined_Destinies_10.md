# #10 [Mr. Tibbs]

I know that I must look like a total tool to my guard but I have never been happier in my life. Raven has been the missing half of me for almost eighteen mortal years. Now that she’s by my side, I’ve never felt stronger.

As we walk into the kitchen, everyone stops and looks towards us, all with knowing smirks on their faces. I wouldn’t put it past one of the brothers to have been watching us from the house, giving the group a play-by-play of our private moment.

Raven pulls me toward the group, and it looks like lunch is in order. Everyone is busy setting out the makings for sandwiches. There is an assortment of meats, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and all sorts of condiments. Iced tea and desserts are off to the side. along with an assortment of vegetables and fruit. Velma knows how to put out a spread. The flat screen TV is on and tuned to the season football game. Tolin and Tiern are so absorbed that they haven’t caught on that food is within their grasp. Oh well, more for the rest of us.

Everyone begins to dig in and before we know it, we are all around the table partaking in a late lunch while Velma is busy throwing together a stew for later tonight.

I smile and look over to see that Raven, Daphne, and Trixie are in an animated conversation, with Trixie flittering about, and Raven and Daphne laughing at her antics. Everything feels right and I take it all in knowing that I’ll have to burst this bubble of normalcy at some point. But Raven and Daphne need this mundane distraction, so this afternoon, I remain quiet, as do my guards. We all know that this short time will come to an end sooner rather than later. This evening we will begin Raven’s assimilation into the Otherworld, or *Faerie*, as we call it.

As the afternoon progresses everyone moves to the main family room. Raven’s mother created an amazing home that is as inviting as it is homey. There is plenty of seating as we crowd into the room to watch the next game. Tolin and Tiern take center stage as always with their banter, and everyone is relaxed and enjoying the brief reprieve.

As the light of day begins to fade into twilight, I pull Raven close to me. “It’s time to hear about the histories; are you ready? You need to know your origin and where you come from.”

She looks at me with a confused look, her tawny, amber eyes aglow and says, “I know where I come from. I come from my mother and my father in the year of…”

I pull her closer. “I know, *mo ghrá*. You’re trying to be funny so as not to feel the feelings that you must have now. Whatever you need to get through this, I’ll have your back.”

Now Raven burst into giggles and everyone turns towards her. “Daphne and I both need to learn about a world we never knew existed. Right, Daphne?” She pulls Daphne in for a hug as she nods her head in agreement.

“When the guys came barreling in your hospital room, it changed everything I thought I knew about the world. So, yes, Raven, I need to learn about the new world, right alongside you.”

With that, we move back to the kitchen and the table that will accommodate all of us. The TV has been turned off and Harley makes a fire in the fireplace; even though it’s August and hot outside, it seems fitting. It sets the stage for what’s to come.

“Nemus is best at retelling this part of the histories. There is a lot to get through, and we are not going to get it all done in one night. There will be times when some of us will jump in to help Nemus. The Druids not only wield magick, but are responsible for recording the histories and maintaining the archives,” I say.

Velma has now set the table and everyone passes their bowls around to get a helping of the delicious smelling stew and homemade bread. As everyone gets settled, candles are lit and lights are dimmed. Raven, to my left, takes my hand in hers, Daphne is on the other side of Raven and Elrond is on Daphne’s left. He has not left her side for more than a few moments in the last twenty four hours, and we suspect that Daphne may be more than she appears. She may just be Elrond’s kindred, but I will ponder that later.

“If you’re ready, I’ll begin,” Nemus says with a heavy sigh.

“All religions in the Mortal Realm hold some similarities, and you may find that our histories are not so different from yours. In the beginning, there was one God, one omnipotent being, a giver of life, a creator. The first realm to be created was the Overworld, or heaven, as you may be more familiar with. In the Overworld, celestial beings were created to serve His will. He created nine orders of angels.”

Nemus pauses thoughtfully, and then continues. “It’s said that once all was right in the Overworld, God set about creating the other three realms; the Otherworld and the Mortal Realm, or Earth; and the Underworld or hell. The Overworld and the Underworld are reserved for those souls that have passed on from this life. The Other Realm and the Mortal Realm are reserved for the living. In His infinite wisdom, He also created the Tree of Life that is connected to all four realms, and without the Tree of Life, the foundation that has been made to balance the four realms would be broken, and the Mortal Realm and the Other World would slowly die.”

Nemus at this moment mutters something under his breath, and then waves his hand palm up over the table. An image appears showing the four realms as if on a compass, with the Tree of Life is in the center. “Now the great creator has connected the four realms to the four elements seen.

As the diagram floats above the table, I hear Raven say, “Well. snap; looking at it like this, it all makes sense. But isn’t there something wrong with her right now? When I saw her before, she didn’t seem well to me?”

“I’ll get to that,” Nemus says. “Now, the Mortal Realm and Faerie were once open to one another, and co-existed closely together. As the Mortals began experimenting with technology, the two worlds became distant, until only a few in the Mortal Realm knew of the existence of the other, even though everyone in the Faerie Realm knows of the Mortal Realm. Humans grew away from the beliefs of magick and magickal creatures as technology began to take root, and the Fae that remained in this world began to remove themselves back to Faerie.”

Trixie gets excited at this point. “So that’s why I didn’t feel any dryads in the woods when we came through the portal?”

“Yes, that is why. There are some dryads left here, but they will soon move to Faerie if the Mortal Realm continues as it has.

“Now that I have established the realms and we are all comfortable with the balance of life, I’ll move on to the deities; the gods and goddesses that exist between the realms.

“Once the other three realms were established, God decided to close the portals to the Overworld and the Underworld, so that all who sought entry would truly be souls passing from the Realms of the living to the Realms of the afterlife. In order to maintain order, God took them from his elite angels and asked if any would like to oversee the two worlds as gods and goddesses. The select few chosen for this task were deemed worthy by God and sent to oversee the development of the two worlds. During this time, a war in the Overworld took place and God’s most esteemed angel Lucifer fell from grace, as did many of his followers. They were sent to hell forevermore as the Fallen, along with the demons of their own creation. As the Mortal Realm continued on its path of utilizing mortal technology, the gods that were sent to oversee these two realms withdrew to the Other World and are known as the *Tuatha De’ Danann*. Many deities now reside in the Other World, and conflicts have risen in the past as they realize they are now restricted to reside in one realm and not two.

“As things continue to evolve in the Other World, the dark fae seek to challenge the gods and goddesses. They want to rule it in their own fashion, and in doing so the Morrigan, who now leads the dark fae as their queen, has found a way to poison the Tree of Life.”

Nemus quietly brings the story to a close as everyone around the table allows the lesson to sink in.
