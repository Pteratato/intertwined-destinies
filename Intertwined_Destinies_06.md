# #06 [Mr. Tibbs}

“Daphne, do you know where Raven’s necklace is?” I ask.

“When I woke up after the accident the staff gave it to me for safekeeping. I think it was taken off en route to the hospital. I asked if I could put it back on her but the staff told me no, to just hang on to it. Should I have put it back on her? I have it here.” She reaches over and pulls the top drawer open on the bedside table, then gently pulls out the necklace and hands it to me.

I take the necklace in my right hand, and at the moment Trixie lands on my shoulder in the form of myna bird ruffling her gray feathers. She says, “It kind of looks like a key.”

“Where did that bird come from, and why does it sound like it’s carrying on a conversation with you?” Daphne asks, her eyes widening.

I smile at Daphne. “Well, that’s a long story, but I will say that not everything in the room is as it appears. If we can trust you to not make a commotion, I’ll have Nemus lift the glamor he has placed on all of us before we get started. But you should know that I, Torin, and Tolin are elves. Elrond and Nemus are druids, and, well, the myna bird is a faerie named Trixie.”

Daphne is once again looking at me with wide eyes, but she nods her consent.

“Nemus, we are all friends here, lift the glamor from all except for Torin and Tolin; they are to guard the door. It’s one less thing you’ll have to concentrate on while you work with Raven.”

Nemus just shrugs, and with a wave of his hand the glamor is lifted.

“Oh My Goodness!” Daphne says, staring at the three of us. “I must have died in that accident and this is a weird hallucination in the afterworld. She’s a *faerie*, and you all have pointed ears except for him. Wow!” She shakes her head back and forth as if clearing cobwebs from her mind, but her eyes never stray from Elrond.

I make a mental note to ask Elrond about it later, but right now we have a mission to complete. But before I can focus on that, Trixie lands on my hand to examine Raven’s talisman again.

“It’s beautiful. Is it a key?” She cocks her head and gets down on her hands and knees to take a closer look. She runs her tiny fingers over the piece and says, “there are four trinity knots that are paired together to make a sort of square, connected to a short round barrel with multiple raised edges on either side of the barrel pendant hanging from the necklace. There are amber and diamond stones strategically placed throughout the design. Interesting! I still think it looks like a key.”

“Trixie, can you go introduce yourself to Daphne? Maybe tell her about your first meeting with Raven? Nemus needs to get started.” Shifting my attention to Nemus I walk towards him. “Should I place the necklace around her neck?”

“Yes, and then we will begin.” Nemus is always so serious, but now I can tell he’s about to withdraw into himself in order to perform the ritual that he has been preparing to safely awaken Raven.

I look down on her in this form and realize how beautiful she really is. Her brown hair lays gently swept back away from her face, her skin is a beautiful golden tan, her ears are rounded, and she looks very fragile. I gently place the necklace around her neck and clasp it shut. I lean down and whisper in her ear. “I’ve found you little one; it’s time to wake up. It’s time that we got to know one another. I’ve been waiting for you for a very long time. I’ll lend you my strength, and I’ll be here for you, waiting for you to wake.” I pull back and look down on her face. Then I gently cup her left cheek with my large calloused hand and lean over her to place a kiss on her forehead.

“Begin,” I say quietly and hear Nemus behind me start his chant.

[Raven]

He’s here. I can feel that he’s here. My energy is almost gone, but then I feel his vitality merging with mine. Don’t ask me how I know that’s what happened, but I do. From a far off distance I hear someone begin to chant. Suddenly I’m caught up in a maelstrom of feelings and sensations that I didn’t expect, and then my inner turmoil and pain begin. I reach out to that invisible source of strength and latch to it selfishly, needing to replenish my stores before I’m wiped clean. My dark prison is not so dark anymore. Now, like a computer booting up, I feel my senses come online. I’m on sensory overload and it feels like my body is on fire; like someone has reached into my being and is rearranging my molecular makeup. I’ve never felt pain such as this in all my life. If I had control over my form, I would be screaming and convulsing from the sheer agony of it all. I can sense Mr. Tibbs by my side, and I’m so grateful that he’s here. His touch grounds me and helps me endure the pain that has overtaken my entire being.

I’m not free from my prison, the void, but the agony that is racing through my body is about to unhinge me. The only comfort I have is Mr. Tibbs, and then I hear, “I have you, Raven, always. Take what you need from me to get through this transition. I’ll be right here by your side. We’re kindred souls, and I have been waiting for you my entire life.”

With these words I let go of all that I’ve been holding on to. I feel my body begin to change, evolve. The pain slips away as I feel my form lift off the bed that I’ve been laying upon. Mr. Tibbs lets go of my hand, and a warm comforting light begins to warm me from the inside out. As the light continues to build I can feel it pulse through me.

I’m pulled into an upright position in midair and I begin to slowly spin, emanating light from four parts of my being. I feel the subtle changes start to take hold and in one last moment, I feel my body contort with an excruciating pain. I pull my legs and arms to my chest and then suddenly I straighten out, suspended in midair, arms and legs thrown out with light emanating from my body before I descend back down to the bed I occupied before. The energy recedes leaving me exhausted, but free from my prison. The chanting subsides.
