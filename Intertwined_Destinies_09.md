# #09 [Raven]

Trixie the myna bird flutters about my head for just a moment until Nemus drops the glamour that conceals us all. That’s when I discover that Velma and Harley are both elves; to say I didn’t see that coming would’ve been an understatement. Then Velma takes one look at me and begins to gush, going on about how beautiful I am and how she always knew that I would be something special.

Being home should be comforting, but I find that I’m feeling oddly out of place. Walking in the house, I take in all the familiar surroundings and I swallow back the tight knot in my throat. I already feel her absence from this place as we make our way to the back of the house where the oversized kitchen and sitting room are located.

Everyone begins to settle in, talking amongst themselves. When no one is looking, I quietly make my way out the back door to the deck that overlooks a gentle sloping yard and a tranquil brook. The house and yard have been nestled back into a wooded area that I have always thought looks like a place out of a storybook. I’ve always loved this area the most.

The sound of the gurgling water in the brook and the warmth of the afternoon sun filtering its way through the trees have always felt magickal to me.

I find that I am craving the serenity that this place holds. I wander out into the yard and down to the brook, making my way to the tiny, arched bridge that Mom had put in just for appearances. I love this bridge. There are four Adirondack–style wooden chairs and a fire pit by the brook; a patio of sorts. Mom always had a green thumb and when she was not at work, I would find her puttering around out here, putting out all kinds of plants and flowers and creating this tranquil place that I love so much.

I find what I need to start a small fire in the pit, just because I long to hear the crackle of the fire mixed with the sound of the stream. Afterwards, I sit back to take in the familiarity of my surroundings. I can no longer hold my tears at bay and I cry for everything that I have lost. I cry for everything that I do not know, and I cry for my lost innocence and I sit by the quiet babbling brook.

“Please don’t cry, my lady.” I hear a quiet little voice.

I look around with a tear-streaked face. “I’m sorry, who are you? Where are you?”

A tiny sprite bashfully looks out from behind a giant mushroom not far from me. She is tiny, much smaller than Trixie, and has long, brown hair with a sort of circlet crown made from leaves, twigs, and flowers. Her brown eyes look sorrowful, and her skin, wings, and dress are all designed to blend into her surroundings.

“I’m so sorry for the loss of your mother,” the sprite says, “she was always so good to the trees and the flowers, and everything around the house. She took care of her land here. I wish that I could have thanked her personally for the care she took. Such an amazing soul is with the gods and goddesses now. Please don’t fret, my lady. I will take care of this place while you are away.”

I swallow back another sob and ask, “What’s your name? And have you always been here? If so, why am I just seeing you now?”

“Freya, my lady,” she says. “I’m a wood sprite and made this place my home not long after you came to live here. I have always been around keeping an eye on things along with Velma and Harley. As a wee child you would chase me through the trees, but as you got older you could no longer see me. You were being raised as a human child by a human mother. But now that you have gone through your awakening, all things fae will be seen by you.”

As I ponder her words I vaguely remember playing in the woods and telling Daphne about my wood faerie, but she never saw what I saw. As I grew up, I stopped looking for my imaginary friend.

“Freya, thank you for reminding me of that magickal time in my childhood. I remember you now. I’m not really sure what happened to make me forget you but I’m so sorry that I did. Everything is so confusing now. There’s so much that I don’t know, and so much to learn. And you’re right, I do believe I will be going away for a while and I don’t want my home to disintegrate into disarray. Thank you for always being here; I’m comforted by knowing that.” I release a heavy sigh, then add, “I don’t wish to be rude, but I need to be alone for now– there is so much for me to ponder, Freya. Maybe we can talk later?”

Freya smiles sadly and nods her head in my direction. “Of course, but please don’t worry about anything here, all will be taken care of.” She says and flits back into the trees. Just then I feel Mr. Tibbs walk up behind me.

“Will you send me away, too?”

“Of course not, come, sit. I just needed some me time. So much has changed. I’m burying my mother, sister, her husband, and my nephew tomorrow. I don’t know how Daphne is holding it together. I love this home so much, but everything is so different now. The mother that I have always known is gone. She was everything to me.”

I break down, sobbing.

“She was my whole world. I don’t know how to move on right now. I know that I have to, but she has always been there to pick me up when I fall. Who is going to do that now?” I ask and looked up at him, tears running down my grief-stricken face.

“I will.” He says quietly, pulling me up to my feet and into his embrace. “I will always be here for you, and though I could never ever take the place of your mother in that regard, know that I will do my very best to be the partner you need. To be your friend, your confidant, your kindred, and I will support and protect you always.”

He gently pulls my face up from where I have laid it on his chest and looks deeply into my eyes. “It’s time for the two of us to get to know one another, and though it is true that I have waited eighteen years to be in this moment with you, I want you to understand that I will take things slowly. I know that you’ll need some time to adjust to everything; to feel the bond between us and to allow that bond to grow.”

As I look up into his beautiful blue eyes, I see the truth of what he says and ponder the bond that I feel for him. It is strong, moreso now than before when I was in limbo, and I know that he has branded himself across my heart, and I will never want another. It’s true that we have only just met, and I know not the first thing about this elf-man and his life in the Otherworld but I want to learn everything I can about him. His presence in my life is something that I crave deep in the core of my being.

I push myself up on my toes and take his handsome face in my hands and whisper, “Kiss me, Elf-man.”

He looks down on me with serious eyes, and then a smile begins to appear as he gently cups my face with his large hands, then he strokes the tears away. He lowers his head and ever so slightly brushes his lips against mine. We let the kiss linger as we breathe each other in. The attraction and need to be close to him are overwhelming and I decide to give into his pull as my hands go around his neck, tugging him closer. I respond to his kiss, opening for him as our tongues lightly brush against one another, lighting a fire within me. My need for him shoots straight through me as I mold my body to his, and he pulls me closer still, and I’m lost in the feel and scent of him.

Our kiss becomes more urgent, more demanding, and the pull I feel to him is electrifying my body with fire and I crave his touch that much more. As if he has heard my thoughts, his hand moves to the back of my neck, pulling me in for more as he hoists me up against him, cradling my bottom in his hands. My legs wrap around him as the pull we feel for one another demands a more intimate mating. Our mouths and tongues dance across one another, and I hear a moan that starts deep in my soul escape into his mouth, and at that moment I rock my hips into his and feel evidence of his desire in the length of him. Desperate for more, I tighten my legs around him and deepen the kiss yet again. His mouth is a wicked pleasure that is fast becoming my addiction.

Mr. Tibbs pulls back, breaking the most incredible kiss I’ve ever had. My very first kiss ever will go down in the record books as the most intense, erotic, unforgettable moment in this girl’s existence. Holy hot tamale, that was intense. He leans his forehead against mine, we’re both panting, trying to digest the moment and get our bearings as he holds me close to him. He is perfection; his body is rock hard with corded muscles that flex with his every move and I find that I can’t get enough of him.

Man I am in deep trouble, for real.

That was just a kiss, and I find that I’m desperate for more as the bond between us continues to grow. I pull back and look deep into his eyes to see his need and adoration.

“Elf-man, this has to be the most amazing first kiss in the history of all the worlds. You’ve gotten under my skin so much that I’m never letting you go. It feels as if you are my other half, and without you I’m incomplete. I want you in my life every way possible and I won’t be whole until that happens. You talk about the bond being allowed to grow, but the bond I feel has just been clicked into place, and I’m not sure what I would do with myself if it grows any stronger. I’m not sure if I’ll be able to exercise patience in that regard. I hope that I’m not the only one struggling here because it would really suck if that were the case.”

Mr. Tibbs looks at me with his signature smirk that makes his dimple pop out, and a chuckle rumbles out of his chest. “I assure you that this is a two way street.”

He slowly lowers me to the ground, and I look around the clearing and realize that there could not have been a more perfect place for our first kiss to have taken place. I look back at Mr. Tibbs to see that he is down on one knee and as my eyebrow quirks up he takes my hand in his and says, “Raven Khorn, will you consider binding with me? Before you ask, it is a lot like the human custom of marriage, but more. Will you at least consider it? I don’t want any others thinking that you are not already promised.”

I hold his hand and look down at him. He seems so uncertain, and I can’t handle that he is unsure of my answer, so I blurt out, “yes, I will bind with you. I know that this is all happening rather quickly and that we have much to learn about one another, but this just feels right. I saw you in what I thought were my dreams, but now I know that my soul longs to be with you. That those weren’t dreams at all but me traveling across realms to be near you. So yes, Mr. Tibbs, I will bind with you.”

He reaches into his pocket of his black cargo pants and pulls out a ring, which he slips on my finger with a smile. It’s perfect. It’s a simple white gold circlet with inlaid baguette emeralds around the entire ring, creating a never ending circle of green. I exhale the breath that I was holding.

“It’s perfect.”

“This is a promise, Raven; my promise to be yours. And by accepting this ring, you promise to be mine. We have much to overcome, and much that will happen in the days to come, but I believe that as long as we stand together, we can overcome anything that is thrown our way.”

“Mr. Tibbs, I have lost a family that I hold very dear to my heart and will grieve their passing for the rest of my days. But I also believe that I have been given a chance at having a new family that I need to get to know. I think I have avoided everything for long enough, it’s time for me to get back in there and face my new reality. What do you think?”

“I think a lot has happened to you in the last week, and you take as much time as you need to adjust. If you think you’re ready we can head back in, we’ve only been gone for around thirty minutes, so maybe we haven’t been missed yet.” He takes my hand in his with a serious look and asks, “Are you ready?”

With a smile, I look up at him and see the meaning behind his words; he’s asking if I’m ready to move forward in the next phase of my life, and although my grief runs deep, there are so many things to be grateful for. There is a whole new world for me to discover, but before that can happen I have to say good-bye to the first phase of my life, and that starts right now.

“Yes, I am ready,” I say as I smooth my hair and my dress, and squeeze his hand in mine. Then we both make our way towards the back of the house.
